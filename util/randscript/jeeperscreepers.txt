EXT. LONELY COUNTRY ROAD. DAY.
An empty ribbon of asphalt. Winding through an endless
stretch of meadows and farmlands. For a long moment, silence.
Then, a distant speck. A car moving toward us.
A SOUND APPROACHING WITH IT NOW. A RADIO BLARING AND TWO
RAISED VOICES SINGING WITH IT.
TRISHA JAMES is a beautiful girl of twenty. Hair blowing in
the breeze of the open passenger window. She sings out,
banging the side of the car with her hand. Keeping the beat
of the boisterous rock song.
She sings with younger brother DARRY. Nineteen. Attractive
like his sister. Lighter hair. Softer looking. Striking eyes.
Voice raised as they speed along. Trying to swallow up the
road as quickly as possible.
The backseat has a couple of suitcases and a large basket
wrapped in a garbage bag. The song comes to an end as Darry
flies through an abandoned intersection.
TRISH
That was a stop sign.
DARRY
You're kidding, right?
TRISH
In your car I'd be kidding.
DARRY
You think we're actually gonna
run into anyone else on this
road? Relax!
(turns the radio louder,
shouts over it)
Enjoy the countryside!
The ANGRY MUSIC WAILING and the car blasting down the
tranquil road. We watch as it heads for what seems like
infinity.
EXT. LONELY COUNTRY ROAD. DAY. SOME TIME LATER.
DARRY
Okay, here comes...
Trish and Darry slowing down now. Coming up on a
camper/trailer. Brother and sister stare at the license
plate: 
 6A4EVR 6A4EVR
DARRY (cont’d)
(reads it loudly)
"Six A Forever!"
(grins)
That's mine! That's five to
five. Tied up.
TRISH
What does it mean?
(off his look)
"Six A Forever" what does it
mean?
DARRY
I don't know.
TRISH
'Cause it says "Sexy Forever",
stupid, that's mine. That's
five to four.
DARRY
Since when did you start aceing
me at this game?
TRISH
Since you were ten. It
involves English and reading.
Darry guns the engine. Goes into the oncoming lane to pass
the camper/trailer.
TRISH (cont’d)
Come on, Darry.
They pass the cab of the truck. An OLD MAN of sixty behind
the wheel. His WIFE next to him. He glares down at Trish and
Darry as they pass him.
DARRY
Sexy forever huh?
TRISH
You know that is you in forty
years.
DARRY
Note to self: Die young.
(checks his rearview)
Any place but here on this
unbelievably endless road.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 2
TRISH
You wanna be sucking in
exhaust fumes on the
Interstate?
DARRY
No I love stopping at train
tracks every ten minutes.
No further comment from big sister. She's suddenly some place
else.
DARRY (cont’d)
You know there's usually a
reason when you like the long
way home.
TRISH
Gee like, maybe I like the
country?
DARRY
(mocking sincerity)
Okay.
TRISH
Just drive, brat.
DARRY
I'm only thinking the same
thing mom and dad are gonna be
thinking: how come you're
driving home for Spring break
with baby brother?
Not heading off somewhere with
"Mr.Poly-Sci-Track-Team-Guy"?
TRISH
And I'll tell you what I'd
tell them: none of your
Goddamned businessWOOOONNNNKKKKKK!!!!!
A DARK VAN HAS SUDDENLY LURCHED BEHIND
THEM BLARING ITS HORN.
DARRY
(swerves a little)
Jesus!
The van is tailgating them at an alarming velocity. Rattling
and shimmying it is so old and distressed.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 3
TRISH
Darry!
DARRY
What's this guy trying to do?!
He tries to find the driver in the rearview. The Van's
windshield is heavily tinted.
TRISH
Just get out of his way!
DARRY
He's nuts!
TRISH
(emphatically)
Get out of his way, Darry!
Darry swerves into the oncoming lane and the van tears
forward. Blasting toward the distant horizon.
Both brother and sister watch breathless. Catching its
rusting and personalized license plate:
 BEATNGU BEATNGU
TRISH (cont’d)
Jesus!
DARRY
(back in the right lane)
Shit!
TRISH
What the Hell is his problem?
DARRY
My first guess: inbreeding!
He has shouted this last word out the window toward the
distant van.
DARRY (cont’d)
Get a load of that thing?
Vehicle of choice for five out
of ten serial killers.
Brother and sister still trying to catch their breath as the
van disappears over a distant rise.
TRISH
God you know what I just
thought of, right?
JEEPERS CREEPERS 4
DARRY
Kenny and Darla.
(off Trish's nod)
They died about a hundred
miles from here.
TRISH
It was the same highway.
DARRY
This highway runs the length
of the State.
TRISH
You think it really happened?
DARRY
That they had to go looking
for her head?
TRISH
No that they never found her.
Or him. They only found the
car.
DARRY
No, they never found her head.
They found the car but they
couldn't find him or her head.
TRISH
Look at me...
(holds out her hand)
I'm still shaking.
DARRY
You don't think every
generation has their
cautionary tale of drinking
and driving on Prom Night?
TRISH
I always heard it was real.
That they were Class of '80.
After I heard that story, I
used to think this was the
highway I would die on.
DARRY
Quite the cheery thinker,
today. What did "Poly-sci guy"
do to you anyway?
JEEPERS CREEPERS 5
She isn't listening. Thoughts elsewhere again.
DARRY (cont’d)
"Beating you"
(off her look)
That was the license plate on
the van: B-E-A-T-N-G-U".
(turns to her)
"Beating you", that's five to
five. That ties us up.
TRISH
You can't call it now.
DARRY
My ass...
TRISH
You have to call it when you
see it!
DARRY
I was in shock!
THE JANGLING BELLS OF A RAILROAD CROSSING AHEAD.
DARRY (cont’d)
You know I don't remember
there being so many rules to
this game.
Trish and Darry slowing as the bells ring and the bars lower.
DARRY (cont’d)
'Course when there was, you
were the one making 'em.
Little Miss Junior Nazi with
the Barbie Doll and the Easy
Bake Oven...
Darry looks down the tracks. Sees the small cargo train
approaching. Revs the engine.
TRISH
Don't you dare.
(off his look)
My car.
Trish sniffs. Smells something. Looks in the backseat. The
big thing covered in a trash bag. She lifts the plastic: a
full laundry basket.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 6
TRISH (cont’d)
You are a class act, you know
that?
DARRY
Hey you live off campus.
(she just stares at him)
You ever try and do laundry in
a dorm? What they don't steal
they dye pink for you. I've
got twelve pair of rosey-pink
jockey shorts.
TRISH
Maybe they know something
about you, you don't.
She takes the Deodorizer hanging off the rearview mirror and
stuffs it in the bag.
TRISH (cont’d)
Hi mom, haven't seen you
forever, here's my dirty
shorts.
The train is upon them now. He shouts over the din.
DARRY
Its for her, not me. I have to
bring home laundry. I don't,
she gets depressed. Like she
thinks I don't need her
anymore or something.
Trish's look says she isn't buying it. The SHORT TRAIN ROARS
PAST. Leaves the car waiting for bells to stop and the bars
to rise.
TRISH
You talk to her lately?
DARRY
To tell her I'd be home for
break.
TRISH
She sound like anything was
going on?
Darry throws her a look.
TRISH
(impatient)
Did you listen to her voice?
JEEPERS CREEPERS 7
DARRY
Specify please.
TRISH
I think maybe something's
wrong.
(off his look)
I don't think they're telling
us.
(off his continued look)
Like you would notice anything
past the point of your own
selfish little existence.
The bars go up and the car flies over the tracks. Continues
its trek down the two-lane.
DARRY
If mom and dad were gonna get
a divorce don't you think
they'd have done it by now?
TRISH
No I think they would've
waited till we were both grown
and off at school.
DARRY
Whatever.
TRISH
She's not happy. Not even a
little bit. Not like she used
to be.
DARRY
Who is?
(spots something)
Hey...
They are driving past an old abandoned church set back from
the road.
DARRY (cont’d)
You see it?
Her sister peers past him. In the church's side yard, the old
van is parked. The one that almost ran them off the road.
DARRY (cont’d)
It's "Beating You".
TRISH
What's he doing?
JEEPERS CREEPERS 8
But what they both see now is something much more ominous:
A tall, dark figure dropping something large and oblong down
an old drainage pipe in the back of the church.
DARRY
What the Hell is that...
The oblong object is gone in an instant. Swallowed up by the
large mouth of the old protruding pipe.
The kid's view blocked now by the church.
TRISH
Don't slow down!
DARRY
You think he saw us?
TRISH
What the Hell was he doing?
DARRY
He dumped something down that
pipe.
TRISH
Wrapped in a sheet.
DARRY
Wrapped and roped in a sheet.
TRISH
Wrapped and roped in a sheet
with red stains on it.
Both of them study the rearview mirror now.
TRISH (cont’d)
Vehicle of choice for five out
of ten what?
Darry guns the engine.
DARRY
I don't think he saw us.
TRISH
Don't get us killed.
DARRY
You see him?
Both watch the old church get smaller in their view.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 9
TRISH
Nope.
Someone appears high on the old roof. Standing next to the
sagging steeple.
DARRY
What theAppears
so suddenly it could almost be the Figure had leapt
up there.
Darry stares at this, perplexed.
DARRY (cont’d)
You see that?
She hasn't. Just the distant figure on the roof, looking
after them. Some kind of long coat flapping in the wind like
a cape.
TRISH
Just get us out of here Darry!
The figure drops from view as quickly as he appeared.
A glance between brother and sister and Darry increases speed.
DARRY
Grab my cell phone!
TRISH
Where?
DARRY
In the gym bag!
Trish starts rummaging. Finds the cell phone. Flips it open.
Powers it up. Staring back at the church.
THE PHONE GIVES OUT A LOW BATTERY ALERT.
TRISH
The point of having a portable
phone idiot, is so that it
works when you need it.
DARRY
I have a power cable for it!
TRISH
(stuffs the phone back in
the bag)
JEEPERS CREEPERS 10
(MORE)
And I have a cigarette lighter
that doesn't work!
DARRY
I told you we shoulda’ taken
my car!
Trish pales. Staring out the back.
In the distance the dark van is now leaving the old church
and taking the road again.
TRISH
Oh Jesus...
Heading toward them.
DARRY
(in the rearview)
You gotta be kidding me...
THEY CAN HEAR THE VAN'S DISTANT ENGINE BEING GUNNED....
Darry floors it, the little car ripping down the highway as
the old van swoops after it -looking like a dark bird of
prey.
Darry staring down at the speedometer. He's up to ninety and
the little car is starting to shake.
Darry checks the rearview mirror. The van still gaining.
DARRY
What the Hell's he got in that
thing? He's got it suped up or
somethingThe
car speeds down the two lane trying desperately to keep distance,
but the van continues to gain -SCREAMING TOWARD THEM.
TRISH
Darry!!! He's right on our
ass!!!
DARRY
I can see him!
The van is only a few yards from them now. Darry's foot
slamming the pedal to the metal.
He and she staring back at the van's tinted windshield.
Glints in the sun. No driver can be seen.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 11
TRISH (cont'd)
DARRY (cont’d)
Hang onTRISH
DarryDARRY
I'm gonna try something.
TRISH
Darry don't kill us...
He is staring up ahead at a gravel road that shoots sharply
off the highway.
Just as the van lurches up to their rear bumper -its dark
face and grill filling the rear and sideview mirrors.
TRISH (cont’d)
Darry what're you doing?
DARRY
Jesus ChristBAM!
THE VAN SLAMS THE BACK OF THE CAR.
At its top speed, the car shimmies and shakes. Darry weaves
in and out of the oncoming lane several times before
regaining control.
DARRY (cont’d)
I don't believe thisWOOOONNNNKKKKKK!!!!!
THE HORN FROM THE VAN BLARES -but it is
a sound they have never heard come from an auto before.
This could almost be the deep, guttural sound of a wailing
beast.
TRISH
What the Hell does he want?!
(screaming out the back)
Are you out of your fucking
mind?!!!
WHAM! The van hits the back of the sedan again.
DARRY
Christ!
Darry almost in tears. Trying desperately to control the car
as it crosses the oncoming lane and roughly lurches onto the
dirt shoulder.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 12
The sedan shakes violently as Darry tries to get it back onto
asphalt again.
His sister screams -a big ditch dead ahead. Darry grapples
the wheel and as the sedan spits up dirt, he swings the car
back onto asphalt again.
The van tails them across the oncoming lane and back across
the highway.
WOOOONNNKKKKK!!! THE STRANGE, BRUTAL HORN WAILS AGAIN.
Darry is almost up to the gravel road that shoots off the two
lane.
DARRY (cont’d)
Hang on!
Trish just stares at her brother. The boy is shaken. Eyes
full of fear. She looks back at the van. It is charging ahead
at them again.
TRISH
What the fuck is the matter
with you?!!!!
WHAMM!!! Struck again from behind -Darry really loses
control. Tries to swing onto the gravel roadway -but leaves
the two lane at a terrifying speed, unable to negotiate the
sharp turn.
Blasting through a wooden fence and into an open field.
Darry slams on his brakes as they rocket into tall grass.
The windshield is whipped with grass as the car's brakes lock
up and the vehicle continues to fly forward.
A cloud of birds flutters out of the deep grass in front of
them as inside the car, brother and sister are tossed around
like ragdolls.
Trish trying desperately to fasten her seatbelt. Darry just
leaning into that brake.
TRISH (cont’d)
Goddammitt!!!
The car swings around and stops. Jostling to a halt in some
even taller grass and bringing a sudden and eerie silence.
Only the breathing of brother and sister can be heard inside
the car.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 13
That and the sound of the van's engine pounding away in the
distance.
Out Trish's dirtied window, she can see the highway through
the grass. She and Darry stare out.
The old van is not even slowing. Continuing at its terrifying
speed down the two lane.
Brother and sister staring after it. Breathless as it
disappears in the distance.
They look at each other. Both seem to be intact. Without a
word, Darry opens the car door. In some kind of shock. Takes
a step out.
ANOTHER GAGGLE OF BIRDS SUDDENLY FLAPPING THEIR WINGS.
Blasting out from deep grass beyond Darry. Scares the shit
out of him.
DARRY
You fuckers!
Picks up a rock. Throws it at their ascending cloud. Needs to
take out his anger and frustration. Picks up another one.
Looks over at his sister.
Trish is standing now, staring out at the highway. The van
long gone.
DARRY (cont’d)
Still like the country?
She turns and looks at him.
DARRY (cont’d)
The next time Poly-Sci guy
pisses you off I'm gonna kick
his fucking ass!
Trish just looks at the car, surrounded by the tall grass.
EXT. GRAVEL ROAD. DAY. MINUTES LATER.
Dirtied and scraped, the small car emerges slowly from the
tall grass. Trish behind the wheel now. Darry looking out the
passenger window.
They back out of the field. Through the opening in the wooden
fence that they made going in. Roll the car onto the gravel
drive.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 14
Pointed again toward the highway, Trish guns the engine but
doesn't move. Looks to her brother.
DARRY
Sounds alright, I guess.
TRISH
Like either of us would know.
DARRY
(defending his manhood)
I know a little.
TRISH
When your car makes a strange
noise you just buy a new tape
Darry, that's what you told
me.
DARRY
Told you? I learned it from
you!
TRISH
Asshole.
DARRY
Bitch.
TRISH
Mama's boy.
DARRY
Daddy's whore.
TRISH
Dick Licker.
DARRY
Ball sniffer.
TRISH
Ass kisser.
DARRY
Butt picker.
TRISH
Hah! Repeat! Ass and butt! You
lose.
Looks over at Trish and smiles. She too. They need a smile
about now.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 15
Trish rolls to the end of the gravel drive. Stops at the
highway. Looks both ways. Darry's hand on the wheel suddenly.
DARRY
I'm thinking past the point of
my own selfish little
existence now, okay?
What if that really was a
person he dumped down that
pipe? What if it was someone
still alive?
Trish just stares at her brother.
DARRY (cont’d)
Someone who needs help but
doesn't get it. Or doesn't get
it 'till it's too late.
TRISH
We can get help just as fast
by getting to a phoneDARRY
You know how far we are from
the nearest pay phone?
TRISH
Is this your idea of an
adventure or something? 'Cause
this is why girls are smarter,
okay?
DARRY
Hey we almost got killed! You
don't wanna even find out
why?!
She isn't wanting or liking this.
DARRY (cont’d)
We look in the pipe. That's
all we do.
(off her look)
We look in the pipe and if
there's nothing there or
nothing we can do, we just
drive on home and call the
cops.
Trish stares unwilling.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 16
DARRY (cont’d)
You know I'm right.
TRISH
Bullshit I do!
DARRY
Look me straight in the eye
and tell me I'm not right.
She won't look at him. He knows he has her now.
DARRY (cont’d)
Come on, right in the eye.
She turns and glares at him as she throws the car in gear.
TRISH
I'm not getting out of the
car.
Darry smiles. Trish heads out onto the highway. Back toward
the old church.
EXT. OLD CHURCH. LATE DAY. MINUTES LATER.
The car stops on the empty two-lane just before the old
church. Darry and Trish regard it. Check the rearview too.
Empty road. Empty church yard.
TRISH
Every bone in my body is
telling me not to do this.
DARRY
Where would men be if they
spent their lives listening to
women's bodies?
She gives him a look. Rolls into the drive. The old church is
sagging and gray and has not been a place of worship in many
years.
They drive around the side. Both staring up at the old
steeple. And the THREE BLACK CROWS perched on the cross where
one arm has rotted off.
The back of the place is covered in soil. No parking lot.
Just moist dirt and leaves. Mulch. And ahead, through the
windshield, the large drain pipe sticking out of the ground.
Trish drives slowly toward it. Stops a few yards away. Looks
at her brother. Suddenly Darry doesn't look so brave either.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 17
DARRY
I'm just gonna look.
TRISH
You look like you're gonna
puke.
Darry opens the car door. Gets out. Looks out to the highway.
Then the surrounding woods in back of the church. No one.
Moves toward the old pipe when the sound of his sister turns
his head.
TRISH
Let's do this and do it fast.
They approach the pipe warily. It is corrugated metal and
sticks out of the ground about three feet. Angled into the
ground, its jagged metal mouth is about three feet wide.
DARRY
Drainage pipe or something?
Trish and Darry stare down the dark tunnel. A breeze comes
out of it. And a terrible stench...
TRISH
Oh my God...
She covers her mouth and stares at her brother.
DARRY
That breeze has to come from
somewhere.
TRISH
Somewhere rank.
DARRY
Doesn't look like a sewer
pipe.
TRISH
Come on Darry! We can't see
anything down there!
DARRY
(nods to the car)
You gotta flashlight?
She throws him a cold look. Moves back to the car. Darry
stares down into the pitch.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 18
DARRY
Hello?
Listens to his echo.
DARRY
Anybody down there?
Again his voice rebounding. Looks back toward the car when
the smallest of sounds drifts up the pipe.
Darry whirls back to it. Stares in. SOMEWHERE DOWN IN THE
DARK, A MURMUR. A SOFT, MUFFLED, HUMAN SOUND.
DARRY
Hello?
(to Trish)
Hurry up!
Trish brings the flashlight. Darry grabs it out of her hand.
Shines it down the long length of metal.
DARRY
Hello?!
(off her look)
There's someone down there!
I just heard them!
(again into the dark)
Hello?!
The light reveals dark earth at the bottom of the pipe. Some
twenty-five feet down.
TRISH
You're hearing things.
Darry tests the strength of the pipe. It is anchored solidly
in the ground.
TRISH
Darry, don't even think about
it.
He hoists himself up into the mouth.
DARRY
I told you I heard someone!
Crouched inside the pipe, he stares down. Holds the
flashlight with one hand and the lip of the tube with the
other.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 19
TRISH
You know the part in scary
movies where somebody does
something really stupid and
everybody hates them for it?
(off his look)
This is it!
A small, scuffling sound from below.
Trish hears this. Darry stares down the tunnel, raking the
darkness with the flashlight. Looks back at her. His
expression asks her Did you hear that?!
Now worming his way further into the opening of the tunnel.
TRISH
No Darry!
DARRY
Let me slide downTRISH
Goddamnitt
DARRY
Just let me get a little way
inTRISH
You're not going down there!
DARRY
I'm not! Just hold my feet.
As he lays down inside the tube, flashlight extended, Trish
grabs her brother's ankles.
DARRY
Anybody down there?
TRISH
God when was the last time you
washed any socks?
DARRY
I see something!
He strains to look back at her. Trish too scared to comment.
DARRY
(shouts down again)
Hello?
JEEPERS CREEPERS 20
TRISH
I'm counting to ten Darry.
DARRY
Something's moving down
there...
TRISH
Then I am letting go and going
back to my carDARRY
Quiet!
(peers forward)
I just saw it again. Something
is definitely moving down hereMoving
alright -directly into Darry's flashlight beam. TWO
TERRIFIED RATS -darting directly at him.
DARRY
Ahhhhh!!!!!
TRISH
Darry!!!!!
DARRY
Rats!!!!
The rodents run right up over his shoulders. He screams.
Thrashes. They scurry onto his back. Rushing up...
TRISH
(trying to keep hold of his
kicking feet)
It's what?!
DARRY
It's rats!!!!
But he doesn't need to tell her. The rats run right at her
now! One down each of Darry's legs!
Trish screams -releasing her brother's still thrashing feet.
It's a tie who screams louder: Trisha stumbling back as the
rats leap to the ground -or brother Darry as he slides all
the way down the large pipe.
A GREAT THUD BELOW. Trish charges toward the pipe as the
rodents scurry into the leaves.
TRISH
Darry!?
JEEPERS CREEPERS 21
Her voice echoes into darkness as she stares down.
TRISH
Darry?!
DARRY
Owww! Fell right on my head.
INT. SUBTERRANEAN ROOM. CHURCH. LATE DAY. SAME TIME.
Darry rubs his neck. Winces in the dark. Rust and dust
trickle down from the pipe. He sits in the dim pool of
daylight from above. Squints up into it.
DARRY
Why'd you let go?!
TRISH
How the Hell're you gonna get
out of there, idiot!
Darry stands slowly. Looks up the drain pipe.
DARRY
I can climb out, relax your
crack.
He bends and gropes for the flashlight outside the circle of
light. Finds it. Switches it on.
The first thing the light hits, is the edge of something
wrapped in a bloody sheet.
Darry stops. This is what they saw being dumped down the
tube.
TRISH
Darry?
Brother doesn't answer. Takes a terrified step toward it.
TRISH
Do it then, climb out please.
There can be no question it is a body. Blood stains on the
head and midsection. Sheet around it. Tied with rope at the
neck and ankles.
DARRY
Say not so, sis.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 22
TRISH
(peering down)
What?
DARRY
(to himself now)
Say not so...
He bends to it. Studies the head as he pales.
DARRY
Hello?
Feels like an idiot talking to it. But does anyway.
DARRY
Did I hear you down here?
No response. Swallows. Has no choice but to touch it. Gently
on the arm. Pushes it. Testing it.
TRISH
Darry what in the Holy Hell
are you doing down there?!
DARRY
I found our body.
TRISH
You found what?
Darry still staring at. Paling.
DARRY
I found the body.
Darry starts to get up. Grabbed! By a hand!
DARRY WAILS. Lurches away from it, stumbling back. The body
is moving under its bloody sheet. Twitching. Trying to
breathe.
DARRY
Oh God!
TRISH
Darry?
DARRY
Oh God!!!
Darry dashes toward it. Crashes to his knees. Starts tearing
at the sheet around its head.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 23
The sheet being sucked in and out around the mouth now. It is
gasping for air.
Darry trying to tear the sheet. To get a grip on it. The body
thrashes.
Finally -RIPPPPPPP!!!!!! The sheet tears away and Darry
stares down in shock.
It is A YOUNG MAN. About his age. Deathly gray. Mouth open in
mute agony. Eyes wide. Blinking up at him.
Darry can only stare in terror. He doesn't know what to do.
Frantically grabs the sheet. Tears it the rest of the way
down the body -stopping abruptly.
The young man's bare body has an incision of ugly black
stitches --all the way from the navel to the neck.
Darry thinks he might be sick. Looks up into those wide eyes.
What in God's name did someone do to you?
Both boys stare at each other helplessly.
TRISH
Darry?
DARRY
(can whisper back)
Trish...
The boy's dry, blue lips are opening. The Adam's apple bobs
as he tries to swallow. Darry crazy with fear, leans down.
His ear at the boy's lips as they part again.
DARRY
What?
A whispered word comes out of his mouth. Choked. Raspy.
Unintelligible.
DARRY
What did you say?
But no more sound comes. Nor breathing. Darry staring wideeyed.
Almost catatonic. Backs off him. Slowly.
TRISH
I am up here all Goddamned
alone little brother! Now get
your ass up here, it is
getting dark!
JEEPERS CREEPERS 24
Her angry voice echoes down. Darry moves to the puddle of
light and looks up at her.
TRISH
Is she dead?
DARRY
He.
TRISH
Come on, before that guy comes
back!
Darry nods. Goes to hoist a foot up into the tube but stops.
His flashlight has swept over something else outside the aura
of daylight.
He throws the light along the damp earth, past the lifeless
body of the boy and over to...
Two more bloody, sheet-wrapped bodies. Piled on top of each
other.
Darry in shock... Stares numbly at them. Swallows. Starts to shake
his head 'no'. Cannot accept this. Will not accept this.
Darry charging now, back toward the pool of daylight.
EXT. OLD CHURCH. LATE DAY. SAME TIME.
Above, Trish sees him hoist himself into the tube and start a
furious, frightened climb toward daylight.
DARRY
Darry?
A climb so violent the pipe rocks and shimmies. Rivulets of
soot and rust trickling down the metal surface.
TRISH
What's the matter...
But little brother isn't answering. Just clamoring
desperately to get back up top and away from this place
forever...
Halfway up he slips. THE PIPE GROANS as he tries to get new
footing.
TRISH
Be careful!
JEEPERS CREEPERS 25
He looks up at her. His face is dirty and his eyes wide with
child-like horror.
TRISH
This whole thing is moving...
He catches his breath, still staring up at her.
TRISH
Say something Darry, you're
scaring the shit out of me!
Darry starts up again. His sister reaching down toward him:
Slow crane up: moving above the pipe and above the church.
High enough to look down the lonely two-lane:
And see a van headed toward them in the distance...
Darry reaches up for his sister's hand as the PIPE SHRIEKS
AGAIN. More soot dislodging. Running past him.
TRISH
Shhh!!!
She hears THE APPROACHING ENGINE. Looks down at little brother.
TRISH
Someone's coming...
(off his look)
Someone's coming!!!
In a new panic he grabs Trish's hand. With a concerted effort
big sis pulls little brother up to the mouth of the pipe.
TRISH
(trying to look behind her)
Hurry!!!!
WRRANNKKKKK!!!! The pipe makes A NEW, SHRILLER KIND OF
SOUND... and Darry can feel the entire thing shift.
Really clutching his sister's hand now. Grabs the lip of the
pipe with the other. But a piece of its jagged, torn metal
stabs into his palm.
He yells. Retracts his hand violently. Loses his footing.
Slides out of Trish's grip. Down he goes again. Thrashing all
the way.
TRISH
Darry!
JEEPERS CREEPERS 26
Gets his footing halfway down. Examines the gash in his hand
when PING! PING! Just beneath his sneakers, the rusty welds
holding the lengths of the pipe together -snap!
Darry in the middle of the tube. Staring up at his sister
with wide eyes. AS A LOW, ACHING METAL GROAN BEGINS, BUILDING
QUICKLY....
Darry scrambling up toward the mouth as he realizes what is
about to happen.
Almost to the top when the bottom half of the massive tube
falls away. Darry sliding down again with the great jolt.
Both he and the pipe plummeting down into the darkness in a
great cacophony of sound and dust.
TRISH
Darrrrry!
Tries to see through the cloud of dust that shoots up out of
the tube AS THE SOUND OF THE APPROACHING VAN GETS LOUDER.
She whirls toward the highway. Dashes toward her car. Huddles
in front of it. Peers around the left front wheel. Her heart
racing.
The van comes into view...
But not a dark van. This is another, newer van. And it
continues down the two-lane without ever stopping.
INT. SUBTERRANEAN ROOM. CHURCH. DUSK. MOMENTS LATER.
Darry sitting on the ground against the fallen half of the
pipe staring at the gash in his hand. Stares up with Trish's
voice.
TRISH
It wasn't him.
DARRY
You know you really suck!
(stands, holding his arm)
In the moment of truth you
really don't know how to hang
on do you? You just suckTRISH
You were the one who wanted to
come back here and have a
little adventure!
JEEPERS CREEPERS 27
Darry is staring over at the bodies. The two still in sheets.
He stares up at his sister again.
TRISH
Well I hope there's another
way outta there.
DARRY
(angry)
Well it's a church basement so
I'm guessing the church!
The sagging old church. Especially forboding as she regards it.
TRISH
You don't think I'm going in
there?
DARRY
You have to stay out front and
watch for people.
(off her look)
You see anyone? Flag 'em down!
Tell 'em to get the cops out
here right away!
Trish liking this less and less.
DARRY
I'm gonna find a way up.
He starts to move off but calls her again.
DARRY
Trish?
(off her look)
You see that van coming, you
get back to this pipe and
holler down as loud as you
can.
Now she couldn't like the whole idea less. Darry staring at
those bodies again.
DARRY
I gotta find the flashlight.
Trish hurries to the car. Keeping an eye on the old highway.
She gets in. Starts the engine.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 28
INT. SUBTERRANEAN ROOM. LATE DAY. SAME TIME.
Darry takes the flashlight out from under the fallen length
of pipe. Tries it. It still works.
Letting his light lead him, he moves forward..
Ahead: the other two bodies. Piled together. These
bloodstains are darker. Browner. How long have they been down
here?
Darry draws in a breath. The smell is getting putrid.
In the same moment his light ascends. There are words over
his head. An epitaph, spelled out in bones:
WHERE THERE'S A HELL THERE'S A
WAY
Darry really gets a chill now. Doesn't want to wonder if
those are human bones. Arranged as they are, on a high arch
that leads into a larger, darker subterranean room.
Where a hand is sticking out of the wall.
His light falls over it. The skin on its splayed fingers
looks petrified. Is this a human hand?
No question: The rest of the body is part of the wall.
Skin leathered with age. Like beef jerky. Teeth infected with
termites... Head back, mouth open in a scream long gone
silent. A body in a wall.
But more light reveals more horror. A WALL of bodies.
DARRY
Oh no... oh God...
Darry steps forward, knees shaking. The vast room ahead, is
walled with dozens of these mounted corpses.
Men and women of all ages. Body after body.
Stitched together in a hideous tapestry. Large stitches.
Identical to those just uncovered beneath that bloody sheet.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 29
Darry swings the light to the other side of the chamber.
Another grotesque mural of the dead, extending deep into the
darkness ahead...
God how many bodies are down here?
Darry moves forward -drawn by his own need to prove none of
this can possibly be real!
Some bodies are turned away. Skeletal heads looking back over
their shoulders -petrified backsides showing more stitches.
Several are as armless as the Venus DeMilo. Some missing
other limbs. Heads. Feet. Genitals.
Darry's growing repulsion moves him faster -how big is this
room? Feels like a football field...
Deeper along the hideous walls, Darry turns abruptly. Two
withered corpses in the tapestry.
On the finger of one: a large ring. An old Varsity ring. His
beam reflecting off its dusty jeweled surface. Darry stares
at it with unquestionable recognition.
Looks slowly to the corpse beside it. A girl? Once? Her
incision is all around her neck. As if her head had been
severed and then sewn back on.
EXT. OLD CHURCH. DUSK. SAME TIME.
Trish parked at the corner of the old church. Keeping an eye
on both directions of the empty two lane. Watching the long
shadows as the sun drops.
Feels something creeping over her. Looks up.
The sun is dropping behind the steeple of the church, the
shadow of the tower slowly falling on her.
She sits anxious in its growing darkness.
INT. SUBTERRANEAN ROOM. CHURCH. DUSK. SAME TIME.
The same below: Darry staring back at the distant archway and
the dying sunlight.
Looks ahead at the cavern of the dead. The ambient light
fading away over all those twisted faces... this place is
getting really dark.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 30
Darry takes a breath and moves forward quickly. Not quite
running. The darkness won't allow this. But walking as
quickly as he ever has...
The deeper he gets, the fresher the bodies.
They no longer have the withered faces and skins like apple
dolls. They have been a part of the walls for less time.
Darry moves faster. Almost running.
Grimacing faces of the dead, gaping mouths of mute agony
shouting him on.
Now practically sprinting through this corridor of death.
Tries to keep his eyes straight ahead. Doesn't want to look
at them. Tries not to...
Steals a look to one side. Looks back and WHAMMM!!!! Runs
directly into someone reaching out for him!
Darry has fallen and screams. Backs up on all fours. Stops.
The figure reaching out is just another corpse on a new wall
in front of him. He has finally arrived at the end of this
horrible room.
Between this corpse and another, Darry can see hinges.
DARRY
You're fucking kidding me...
This withered corpse, with his outstretched hand is a door.
He looks at the hand. The handle? This is what I have to pull
to get out of here?
He swallows, draws a breath and reaches out. Avoids the
leathery fingers and takes the forearm. Gets his grip.
Pulls! The door doesn't move! Darry can't believe what he's
doing. Gets a tighter grip and pulls again! Hard!
This door hasn't been opened in years.
Reaches out again -when the corpses' head turns toward
him.... with its empty eyes and gaping mouth!
Darry leaps away. Staring terrified.
But the head has only been jarred loose. It falls now, right
off the neck. Hangs by a leathery strand of flesh.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 31
This is enough! Darry reaches out. Yanks with all his might
on the forearm of the headless man and in a terrible frenzy
dislodges the door.
It comes off its hinges and topples toward Darry -corpse and
all.
The door is heavy and it hits hard -but not as hard as Darry
hits the ground.
The corpse falling on top of him -the head still attached by
some brittle tendon, nuzzles into his shoulder.
Darry doesn't have time to scream -he throws the door off him
and scrambles forward, through the dark open doorway and up
some dusty steps beyond.
Climbing and screaming. Screaming and climbing. And climbing
some more...
EXT. OLD CHURCH. NIGHT. MOMENTS LATER.
Down the highway, two headlights appear.
Trish instantly afraid. Stares down at them. Could this be
him?
Trish looks at the church. Where the Hell is he?
The headlights closer now. The vehicle is big. The van?
She is suddenly unreasonable with panic. Doesn't know what to
do. --The lights of the oncoming vehicle starting to show on
her face.
She ducks. Below the dashboard. Can hear THE ENGINE. HEAVY
LIKE THE VAN. Lights spilling across the dash now. She
reaches up from below. Turns the key.
The engine won't turn over.
Lights really bright now. Almost upon her. Turns the key
again. Goddamn thing won't start!
Trish's eyes starting to well. Light filling the interior of
the car. The engine finally sparks. She is ready.
But the lights are passing now. And she peeks over the dash
at nothing but an old pick up continuing on down the highway.
Trish sits up- SCREAMS!!! SOMEONE AT HER WINDOW. STARING IN.
DARK FACE. WIDE EYES ETCHED IN THE DYING LIGHT OF THE PASSING
TRUCK.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 32
Darry. Almost comatose, staring in at her.
TRISH
Goddammit Darry!!!!
He just stares.
TRISH
You asshole!
Sees that something is very wrong. Little brother just
staring back.
EXT. LONELY COUNTRY ROAD. NIGHT. MINUTES LATER.
Trish drives in silence. The highway rushing past them. Keeps
throwing looks at her brother. Still as a statue. Face dirty.
Bloody hand wrapped in a piece of torn T shirt. Eyes staring
ahead.
Oncoming headlights now. Both brother and sister study them.
Another truck. It rushes past.
A sign up ahead:
TRENTDALE 25 Miles TRENTDALE 25 Miles
She watches it fly by. Looks to him again.
TRISH
Would you please just say
something?!
(no response)
I mean it Darry, you're
scaring the shit out of me!
His voice as subdued as she has ever heard it.
DARRY
I saw 'em, Trish. Kenny and
Darla. Class of '80.
She just stares.
DARRY
They were down there, both of
them.
(holds up a hand, not
looking at her)
I saw his ring. He was still
wearing his Varsity ring.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 33
TRISH
You said that happened a
hundred miles from hereDARRY
I said I saw 'em!
(angry silence)
All dead and dried up down
there with a whole bunch of
others, okay!?
She more frightened by his state than by his words.
DARRY (cont’d)
Don't tell me you don't
believe me, alright?!
(points a rabid finger at
her)
Don't make me tell you
everything I saw down there
'cause you don't wanna hear
it, okay?!
Her brother's eyes fill with angry tears. Then goes silent
again. Drops his head against the window.
Trish looks at the fuel indicator. Only a quarter of a tank
left.
DARRY (cont’d)
She did lose her head.
Looks over at her brother. Staring out the window into the
passing night.
DARRY
Darla lost her head just like
they said.
(off her look)
And you know what he did,
Trish? You know what he did
for her? He sewed it back on.
Darry lets out a little laugh. Is he going crazy?
DARRY
Sewed it right back on.
EXT. TRENTDALE. NIGHT. TEN MINUTES LATER.
Trish's sedan rambles off the two-lane and toward a small
cluster of buildings under the starry night sky. Past a
weathered and aging sign that reads:
JEEPERS CREEPERS 34
Welcome to TRENTDALE Population 517 Welcome to TRENTDALE Population 517
Brother and sister look to each other. Neither wants to stop.
TRISH
We have to or we're not gonna
make it home.
She continues on toward the only lights. Combination
Restaurant and Gas Station. The tall sign stretching into the
stars announces plainly:
DELROY'S GAS AND FOOD DELROY'S GAS AND FOOD
Trish pulls in. Rolls under the hot white neon over the gas
pumps. Looks over at little brother.
TRISH
You gonna make a phone call?
Darry just nods. Opens the car door.
TRISH
Throw some water on yourself.
You look like you just crawled
out of a sewer.
Darry moves with fatigue toward the restaurant. Several cars
and big trucks parked around it.
Trish moves to the pump. There is a pad lock on it. She grabs
it. Yanks on it. Turns to her brother.
TRISH
Darry?
(off his look)
Pumps are locked.
She watches him turn and move inside.
INT. DELROY'S FOOD AND GAS. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
Darry steps in. Darker than he expected. Stares ahead. Etched
in the light of a cigarette machine.
He must look pretty bad because those who do catch a glimpse
of him, take another one quickly.
Like the PLUMP WAITRESS eye-balling him. She is fiftysomething.
Name tag reads BEVERLY.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 35
WAITRESS BEVERLY
Restrooms are for paying
customers, kiddo.
DARRY
Could we get some gas, please?
The woman looks out the window, sees Trish leaning against
the car.
WAITRESS
(a well worn rhyme)
Pump's locked at eight
o'clock.
Darry has no energy to argue. Looks out at his sister.
DARRY
Lights are still on.
WAITRESS
(calls back to the kitchen)
Arnie, you got the pump lights
on again!
Trish suddenly plunged into darkness. Waitress Beverly looks
back to Darry as if that settled everything.
DARRY
We really need some gas.
WAITRESS BEVERLY
You look like you need a
little more than gas, kiddo.
EXT. DELROY'S FOOD AND GAS. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
Trish is fit to be tied. Storms toward the diner. Cursing
under her breath. Is almost to the front doors when out on
the two lane comes the sound of a familiar engine.
This is the sound of the van. There can be no question.
She spots it instantly. Sailing down the highway. Speeding
past Trentdale. Knows it must be headed back to the old
church.
INT. DELROY'S FOOD AND GAS. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
Trish bursts in. Patrons staring at her. TWO TRUCKERS
especially. They don't make eyes at her, but she knows the
look. Beverly pouring coffee for them.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 36
WAITRESS BEVERLY
Pumps locked at eight o'clockTRISH
This is an emergency!
Her raised tone turns more than a few heads.
TRISH
I need you to please call the
police.
(off her look)
Right now. Please get them
here right away.
Waitress Beverly stares at her now.
TRISH
Someone is dead! Can you
please just call someone?!
Trish meets the eyes of other patrons who have heard this. A
FAMILY with TWO SMALL CHILDREN -eyes wide staring back at
her.
WAITRESS BEVERLY
Someone's dead where?
TRISH
Are you gonna call or not?!
Beverly regards her a moment longer and starts back toward
the kitchen. The Men's Room Door opens and Darry comes out.
Washed. Looks better. Until sister rushes at him.
TRISH
I saw him! I saw the van
again!
Darry instantly panicked. Runs toward the windows.
TRISH
I think he's headed back to
the church!
DARRY
You sure it was the van?
TRISH
You think I'm gonna forget
what it looks like?!
JEEPERS CREEPERS 37
Trish lets out an anxious sigh. Falls against the wall.
Between the cigarette machine and the payphone. Holds her
face in her hands.
DARRY
Come on big sis. Hold it
together.
She stares at the floor. Won't look at him.
DARRY
(takes her by the
shoulders)
Come on. Just hold it
together.
(waits for a response)
Think of a time.
TRISH
I don't wanna think of a time.
DARRY
I got one. You were twelve.
'Cause I was nine.
TRISH
Just shut-up DarryDARRY

And we found that big fat
potato bug out in the
backyard? Remember how big it
was, with the big feeler
things on its head?
You bet me five dollars I
wouldn't be brave enough to
eat it.
(she looks up at him)
You remember. ‘Cause I
swallowed it. Whole. Could
feel it crawling down my
throat.
Thought it was gonna make me
sick but I had to prove to big
sis that "I wasn't afraid of
nothing".
Then when I finished
swallowing it you didn't want
to pay me the five dollars so
you yelled "Mom! Darry ate a
bug!"
JEEPERS CREEPERS 38
(MORE)
(the hint of a smile on her
face?)
Remember? I got spanked and
taught about not putting dirty
little things in my mouth?
Remember? What a nasty little
bitch you were?
She smiles at him as much as she's able. Darry thinking he's
cheered her up. But her eyes well with tears as quickly and
she says in a frightened whisper:
TRISH
I am so scared, Darry. He is
gonna get back to that church
and he is gonna know we were
down there!
THE PAY PHONE RINGS LOUDLY BESIDE HER AND SHE SCREAMS.
The entire restaurant is looking at her now. Beverly on the
phone by the registers stares over. Along with a roundish,
furry looking man of fifty or so. The MANAGER.
She and little brother stare back at everyone. Embarrassed.
THE PHONE RINGS AGAIN.
Darry waiting for someone to come over and answer the phone.
THIRD RING NOW.
MAN AT JUKEBOX
You gonna get that?
The MAN closest to them has asked this. He drops a coin in
the slot of the juke.
Trish picks up the receiver. A WOMAN'S VOICE. URGENCY IN HER
VOICE.
WOMAN
(filtered)
Yes hello?
TRISH
Hello?

A confused look from Darry to Trish.

Darry just staring at Trish in utter confusion.
WOMAN
(filtered)
They’re big and they’re blue
and they’re very beautiful.
Darry panicked now. She can see me! He moves quickly to study
faces in the dining area. Yanked back when the phone cord
won't reach.
WOMAN
(filtered)
Please don't be frightened.
You're wearing a pair of blue
jeans where the third belt
loop is torn.
Why is she saying this? Looks to his pants. Third belt loop: torn.

I know how you tore it, too.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 40

edge of a metal pipe.
Darry really in shock now. Stares at big sister. Trish
crowding in to listen with him.

AN OLD WOMAN at the cigarette machine.

There’s a song!
(again Darry’s confused
look at sis)
Jeepers Creepers. Do you know
it? It’s an old song.
INT. UNKNOWN LIVING ROOM. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
We cannot see the woman on the telephone but we hear the CD
player nearby. THE VELVETY TONES OF MEL TORME SINGING
“Jeepers, Creepers, where’d you get those peepers?”
WOMAN
Been recorded about a million
times.
We see several new CDs on a TOWER RECORDS bag. CDs torn open.
FRANK SINATRA, JOHNNY MERCER, MEL TORME... their cases strewn
about. CDs too. All over the table.

Something so terrible you
could never imagine itDarry
hangs up angrily. Moves quickly to look out over the
eatery.
DARRY
You sure you saw that van on
the highway?
(off her look)
'Cause I think the driver
might be in here. On a cell
phone.
TRISH
That sounded like a woman!
DARRY
Well why couldn't it be a
woman? We don't know who it
is!
He rushes past the cigarette machine. Looks out into the
parking lot.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 43
DARRY
Somebody messing with us,
that's for sure! She knew
everything!
TRISH
What did she want?
 Darry turns and regards his sister.
DARRY
For us to wait around, which
is exactly what we're not
gonna do.
INT. DELROY'S FOOD AND GAS. NIGHT. MINUTES LATER.
The juke box finishes its selection. Its mechanical arm
replaces the 45 and selects another. The place fills with
music again.
Trish and Darry at a table in back. Beverly steps up to them
with a coffee pot.
WAITRESS BEVERLY
You kids wanna piece of pie or
coffee or something?
They shake their heads no, staring at two STATE TROOPERS at
the counter, conferring with the Manager.
WAITRESS BEVERLY
Let me know if you change your
mind.
TRISH
You think they believe us?
DARRY
All they have to do is drive
out to that church. They'll
believe every word.
TRISH
I don't know if I would.
He looks up with this.
TRISH
Sounds too much like
somebody's bad dream.
Is she trying to say she doesn't believe him?
JEEPERS CREEPERS 44
TRISH
You don't think that's it, do
you? We're dreaming?
Darry doesn't answer. The juke box fills the silence.
TRISH
Maybe we're having one of
those dreams like in the
Twilight Zone where we're all
ready dead.
You know? We died out on the
road and we just don't know
it?
DARRY
(quietly)
I wanna be home. In my room.
In my bed.
(eyes up to his sister)
Ripping up every Tales from
the Crypt and Fangoria I own.
He looks at her. Tries to smile. He looks so fragile.
TRISH
We will get home you know?
He nods. Feeling foolish.
"Jeepers Creepers, where'd you get those peepers? Jeepers,
Creepers, where'd you get those eyes?"
The juke box. Sinatra. Darry’s blood runs cold. Face
suddenly ashen.
Stares across the diner at the juke. Sis watching him
strangely. Tries to follow his line of sight.
"Gosh all get up, how'd they get so lit up..."
He stands. Looks down at sis. “Gosh all get up, how’d they
get that size?”
TRISH
Darry...?
He moves now. Through the diner. As if drawn by the melody...
“Golly gee, when you turn those heaters on. Woa is me, got to
put my cheaters on...”
Trish watches him from the table. Has little brother gone off
his nut?
JEEPERS CREEPERS 45
Patrons are stopping their eating. Watching him as he passes
by in some confused trance.
“Jeepers, Creepers, where’d you get those peepers? Oh those
weepers, how they hypnotize...”
Darry at the jukebox now. Staring down into its glow. Thinks
he must be losing his mind. His own striking eyes even more
beautiful in the golden glow of the machine.
“Where’d you get those eyes?”
The song goes instrumental. He looks back at Trish. The
Troopers are at her table. Sis looking over at him. Darry
moves back quickly.
TROOPER GIDEON is a tall, powerful looking Native American.
Strong face and piercing eyes. His partner TROOPER WESTON is
a capable looking woman of thirty or so.
TROOPER GIDEON
I was just telling your
sister, we're running the
plates and we've got a unit on
their way out to the old
church.
DARRY
And?
TROOPER GIDEON
Tell me something. These kids
you saw on that wall? Who were
they again?
DARRY
(looks to his sister)
Darla Cleeway and Kenny...
TRISH
-Brandon.
TROOPER GIDEON
Found their car all smashed up
'bout twenty years ago? Am I
remembering this right?
(off Darry's nod)
Those bodies would be nothing
but bones by now. You said he
still had skin on him and a
ring on his finger.
DARRY
What're you trying to say?
JEEPERS CREEPERS 46
TROOPER GIDEON
Not saying anythingDARRY
(on his feet)
I told you -I grabbed one of
them! It was hard. Like
petrified wood! Like he
preserved them or something, I
don't know!
TROOPER GIDEON
Well then how do you know they
were even real bodies?
Darry thrown by this. Stares at the Trooper.
TROOPER GIDEON
Look all I'm trying to do here
is get the facts straightDARRY

I told you the facts: this guy
drives a black van and it
nearly killed us!
We saw him throw a body down a
pipe, that dumps into a cellar
under the old church!
I saw the body! He was a guy
my age and he was still alive,
except that he'd been split
from his neck to his navel and
then sewn back up again!
Now this guy must have a
hundred, maybe two hundred
bodies down there, and I've
seen 'em!
MANAGER
Hey-hey-hey!
Doesn't like this grizzly talk, loud enough for people to
hear.
DARRY
(lowers his voice)
I mean this guy must be the
Heavyweight Champ of all
serial killers!
JEEPERS CREEPERS 47
It is Trooper Weston who first notices people standing up
from their tables and moving to the restaurant windows.
DARRY
You don't believe me? Just
drive out to that church and
see for yourself!
TROOPER GIDEON
No one's saying you're lying,
DariusDARRY
It’s Darry. Darius is my name,
Darry for short.
There is quite a crowd at the windows now and he and Trish
see it.
TROOPER GIDEON
And I said we were doing
everything we know how to do.
They step past Gideon toward the dining area. Waitress
Beverly just coming back in the front doors. Looking directly
at Trish.
WAITRESS BEVERLY
That's your car out at the
pumps, isn't it?
EXT. DELROY'S FOOD AND GAS. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
Trish and Darry blast out into the brisk night. Beverly right
behind them.
Ahead is their car. Still in shadow at the pumps. But the
left rear door is open and spilled out onto the asphalt is
Darry's dirty laundry.
The Troopers join them now. Watching as brother and sister
move quickly toward the car.
WAITRESS BEVERLY
Someone saw him from the
window.
Trish and Darry stop. Turn to her. She nods back to the
patrons staring out from inside.
WAITRESS BEVERLY
Thought they had to be
kidding.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 48
TRISH
Saw what?!
WAITRESS BEVERLY
(impatient)
The man out there at your car!
The kids and Troopers instantly look for him.
WAITRESS BEVERLY
Well he already ran off!
TRISH
A man?
WAITRESS BEVERLY
More like a pervert.
(off their puzzled looks)
That's why everyone was
watching. He was outside the
car there sniffing that
laundry.
Darry and Trish staring at her.
WAITRESS BEVERLY
Holding big handfuls of it
under his nose. Looked like he
was liking it too.
Darry at the car now. Shirts, socks, shorts all spilled out
of the basket. Darry looks back at Trish.
TROOPER WESTON
Ran off which way?
Beverly looks back at the patrons at the window. Hollers to
one of the Truckers.
WAITRESS BEVERLY
Which way he run off, Billy?
A Trucker at the window points out. Beyond the pumps. Down
the empty and shadowy street.
TRISH
It was him.
(to the Troopers)
He had time to get to the
church and then get back hereJEEPERS
CREEPERS 49
TROOPER GIDEON
Alright, we don't need anymore
excitement than we already
haveDARRY
This guy is after us!
(throwing fistfuls of
laundry in the car)
He is after us 'cause he knows
what we saw!
The Troopers stare at each other. Trooper Weston on her
walkie-talkie.
TROOPER WESTON
Central this is 037. Come
back.
Darry finishes with his clothes and goes to shut the door.
DARRY
Hey, you interested in a hand
print?
Trish and the Troopers move quickly toward him.
Gideon squats with Darry at the open car door. Look at the
surface of the car handle. It is smudged with some kind of
fine gray powder.
DARRY
You can dust it, right? Get a
print?
TROOPER GIDEON
Looks like somebody already
did.
He looks up at his partner. A breeze comes up and the "print"
starts to blow away.
Gideon thinks fast. Whips out an evidence bag and catches
some of it as it blows into the wind.
A SLOW CRANE UP: As we rise slowly...
DARRY
What the Hell is that stuff?
TROOPER GIDEON
Gonna find out real quick.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 50
TROOPER WESTON
(on her walkie)
Central, this is 037 do you
copy?
TRISH
Can we please get some gas
now?
TROOPER GIDEON
Everybody just keep calm.
Everything's gonna get taken
care of.
...until we are high above the parking lot. Everyone below
just tiny dots of jabbering color. We have ascended finally
to the top of the sign that reads DELROY'S FOOD AND GAS.
And atop that, a dark Figure is perched. His long black coat
flapping in the night wind as he stares down.
Like some dark bird of prey...
EXT. COUNTRY HIGHWAY. NIGHT. THIRTY MINUTES LATER.
WOOSSHHH!!! Trish's car flies past us down the starlit two
lane. Headlights burning into the night. Behind them, another
pair of headlights. A STATE TROOPER CAR.
Darry looks back at them.
TRISH
(at the wheel)
They're still back there.
DARRY
I'll bet having a good laugh
too.
TRISH
You still don't think they
believe us?
DARRY
(regards his sis for a
moment)
How'd he get up on the roof of
that church?
TRISH
How did he what?
JEEPERS CREEPERS 51
DARRY
It look like he jumped up
there to you?
TRISH
Onto the roof of a building?
Darry feels dumb. Stares out the window.
TRISH
What the Hell was he doing
with your clothes?
She smirks suddenly. Then laughs.
TRISH
Maybe he can leap tall
buildings in a single bound.
I mean he’d have to be
superhuman, otherwise the
smell would've killed him!
INT. TROOPER CAR. COUNTRY HIGHWAY. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
Troopers Gideon and Weston in the car escorting them. Gideon
driving. THEIR RADIO SOUNDS.

This is Central, O37 come

Burning out of control, with

INT. TRISH'S CAR. COUNTRY HIGHWAY. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
Darry watches Trish. She keeps checking her rearview.
DARRY
Don't tell me you actually
like him.
TRISH
Get real.
DARRY
(knows its true now)
Oh God.
(looks back at the cop car)
Should'a known. He's big, dumb
and stupid.
TRISH
Unlike the Braniacs you take
out. Braniacs only if they're
brains come in twos and lift
and separate.
DARRY
You're probably gonna marry a
cop. You have a thing for guys
in uniform or something?
TRISH
Well they’re not quite as easy
as the bimbos you flash those
Bambi eyes at. Watch ‘em fall
down with their legs apart.
Darry doesn’t like this. Reminds him of the phone call. Do
you have big beautiful eyes? Sis checks the rearview again.
TRISH
I did notice he was a little
more interested in getting the
story from me than from you.
DARRY
(bothered now)
Would you stop looking back
there? He's gonna think you're
easy.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 53
TRISH
He did have a nice ass.
DARRY
I know, he was talking out of
it.
Darry cranks up the radio. AN ANGRY ROCK TUNE BLARES.
INT. TROOPER CAR. COUNTRY HIGHWAY. NIGHT. MOMENTS LATER.
CENTRAL VOICE

Plates are fake.
Description of the van those
kids gave, corresponds to a
model from 1947. We're talking

TROOPER WESTON
These kids say that van chased
them doing well over a
hundred, go ahead.

You ever stop to think these
kids might be trying to pull
off some kind of major hood

TROOPER WESTON
Come again?
CENTRAL VOICE

The preliminary came back on
that dust you took off the car
handle? Its dead skin.
BWUMP! Something has hit the roof of the police car.
Gideon and Weston staring up at the roof. Puzzled.

Not just dead skin. Long dead.
That's why it was powder.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 54
INT. TRISH'S CAR. COUNTRY HIGHWAY. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
Trish and Darry staring ahead -ROCK SONG BLARING. Neither
looking behind them.
Something black with a cape whipping in the wind perched on
the roof of their escort's car?
INT. TROOPER CAR. COUNTRY HIGHWAY. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
CENTRAL VOICE

I mean they wouldn't be the
first kids to go and ransack a

You wanna believe that or a
hundred and fifty-year old
corpse opened that car door?
TROOPER GIDEON
Say what?!
CENTRAL VOICE

That's a ballpark on how old
that powdered skin is.
BWUMP!!! ANOTHER SOUND FROM THE ROOF OF THE POLICE CAR. Both
Troopers startled.
TROOPER GIDEON
Hold on Central...
A puzzled Trooper Weston rolls down the window. Rises out of
her seat. Head out the window to get a look up top.
EXT. TROOPER CAR. COUNTRY HIGHWAY. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
Trooper Weston stretches higher now, looks out over the roof
of the patrol car--
What she sees moves so fast in the windy night, she can't
even reactJEEPERS
CREEPERS 55
INT. TROOPER CAR. COUNTRY HIGHWAY. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
Trooper Weston's body is yanked out of the car. Through the
open window! Gone in one powerful, violent motion.
HER SCREAM swallowed instantly as she disappears.
Trooper Gideon in shock. No time to even turn his head--
WHAM!!! The large, razor sharp blade of a battle axe breaks
through the roof of the police car --right in front of his
face.
INT. TRISH'S CAR. COUNTRY HIGHWAY. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
The kids still listening to the loud song. Behind them, the
patrol car swerves erratically. Something dark still riding
on top of it.
DARRY
(shouting)
They're gonna be in Concert in
August, downtown!
EXT. TROOPER CAR. COUNTRY HIGHWAY. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
Trooper Gideon's head is yanked up through a hole ripped in
the roof of the car.
The Figure that grips him, rears back with the same razorsharp
battle axe. Almost Medieval-looking.
And in one neat swoop -swings it at the Trooper's head.
INT. TRISH'S CAR. COUNTRY HIGHWAY. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
Angle behind brother and sister: ROCK SONG BLARING AS
-something big hits the roof of the car. Hard and fast. Flies
down the windshield and off the hood.
Trish slams on the brakes. Both of them clutching the
dashboard. The car swings to a halt in the middle of the twolane.
TRISH
What was that?
Brother sticks his head out the window. Stares into the night
sky. Sis looking behind them.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 56
The Trooper vehicle angled across the two lane. It too has
made a hurried stop. No movement inside. Dark and silent.
Silhouetted in the moonlight.
DARRY
What the Hell?
Brother and sister look at each other. Darry's head again out
the window.
DARRY (cont’d)
Hey!
Darry's voice echoes into the night.
DARRY (cont’d)
You okay in there?
Darry gets out. Trish follows.
DARRY (cont’d)
Stay here.
Trish looks at him. No way!
Darry takes a tentative step toward the moonlit vehicle.
Wishes he could see more.
Trish seeing the dents on the roof of her car where the
object hit. Dents with a spatter pattern. Blood.
TRISH
Darry...
Looks back at her. She holds up three fingers smudged with
blood.
DARRY
(screams at the car)
Hey!
The car's police lights flash on. Startles Darry and Trish.
Both squinting into them.
DARRY (cont’d)
Get back in the car.
(turns to Trish)
Get back in the car!
Someone is staring out behind the wheel of that car.
Peering at them, through the angry flashes of red and blue...
through a windshield spattered with blood...
JEEPERS CREEPERS 57
DARRY (cont’d)
Trish, get in the car!
Trish paling. Turning to do this. Caught by the sight of
something else.
Down the road -just past the police car. A roundish thing in
the middle of the highway -silhouetted in moonlight.
Trooper Gideon's head. Staring out at her with dead eyes.
This is what hit them and rolled off the hood!
TRISH
Darry...
Darry trying to make out the face in the flaring lights. The
eyes. So white.
DARRY
Trish...
The patrol car's door swings open and both of them whirl
around. Back toward their own vehicle. Leaping in.
Trish behind the wheel. Grapples for the stick shift in a
blind panic. Darry just as fast into the passenger seat.
Slams the door.
A tall, powerful silhouette rises out of the patrol car.
Turning instantly away from them.
DARRY (cont’d)
Whoa, did you see that?
As it turns -its face glints for a moment in the moonlight.
The eyes. So white because they are just that and nothing
else.
No pupils or irises. A trick of the moonlight?
Trish staring. The car hasn't moved. Her hand still on the
stickshift.
The figure walks away from them with a chillingly casual
gait. His black coat flapping cape-like. And in the glare of
the flashing red and blue, walks back toward Gideon's head.
Whistling. Whistling a tune the kids have heard in the diner:
Jeepers, Creepers, where'd you get those Peepers?
Brother and sister transfixed. Watching as with a single
hand, the Figure reaches down and lifts Gideon's head by the
hair. Holds it then, in both hands. Looking at it.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 58
Holds it high. Level with its own eyes. Draws it closer. So
close he could be kissing it.
DARRY (cont’d)
(a whisper)
I'm not seeing this.
The Figure turns the grizzly thing around now. Does the same
with the back of the head.
And both kids realize what he is doing. Smelling it...
DARRY (cont’d)
What the Hell are we looking
at, Trish?
More horrid disbelief as the figure drop kicks the head -
sending it high in the sky and off into the tall grass of the
nearby field.
DARRY (cont’d)
Let's get the Hell outta
here...
The Figure turns now. Staring back at them.
DARRY
Go.
Trish guns the engine and the car screams back down the
highway.
The dark figure watches this from afar. Still as a statue.
INT. TRISH'S CAR. COUNTRY HIGHWAY. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
DARRY
What is this guy?
Sees her brother staring out the rear.
DARRY
What is this guy, Trish?
What'd he do to those cops?
TRISH
Don't know and don't wanna.
DARRY
And why didn't he do it to us?
You see the way he looked at
us?
(looks back at her)
JEEPERS CREEPERS 59
(MORE)
Like he's playing with us.
Like running us off the road
was just some kind of game.
EXT. LONELY COUNTRY ROAD. NIGHT.
Back at the scene of the crime, the empty patrol car, engine
running, rolls slowly off the highway and into a field.
The dark Figure watches only for a moment -moving away while
the car still travels pilotless deeper into the field.
Before it even settles, WE CAN THE HEAR THE RUMBLE OF THE
DARK VAN'S ENGINE. We leave the patrol car for a glimpse at
the highway whenWOOSHHH!!!
The dark van rips past us down the moonlit two
lane.
EXT. ANOTHER STRETCH OF COUNTRY ROAD. NIGHT. MINUTES LATER.
Both Trish and Darry see it at the same time. A farmhouse.
Down a gravel drive off the road. Lights on in the windows.
TRISH
There's a phone!
DARRY
You sure you wanna stop?!
TRISH
I wanna get to anyone who can
help us!
DARRY
What's the next town?
TRISH
I don't know and I'm not gonna
wait to find out.
Trish takes the gravel drive. Jostles down the lane.
TRISH
Look we just ask to use the
phone, okay? We don't freak
these people out.
The house comes into more detail. Old and sagging. But its
warmly lit windows like a beacon. Of safety. Sanity.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 60
DARRY (cont'd)
TRISH
We don't wanna scare 'em. We
just wanna call for help.
Headlights etching the overgrown garden that is the front
yard. An ancient pick-up to one side. In the center of the
overgrowth, a sagging thing scarcely presuming to be a
scarecrow.
DARRY
Too spooky.
Trish looks at him. He's serious.
DARRY
Too spooky. Let's just get the
Hell outta here.
At the outskirts of the yard, a plastic sunflower ticks away
in a night breeze as the car comes to a halt.
TRISH
It's pretty run down. Hope
they have a phone.
DARRY
I hope they have a gun.
TRISH
I hope they don't.
She opens the door. Gets out. Darry too. Their first look is
to the highway. Empty. For as far as the eye can see.
KER-CLINK! THE DISTINCT SOUND OF A RIFLE BEING COCKED turns
the kids quickly toward the house.
CAT LADY
Who are you?
A WOMAN'S RASPY VOICE. From a silhouette behind the screen
door. A blue-black rifle barrel glinting in its hands.
CAT LADY
I said who are you?
TRISH
Patricia James. This is my
brother Darry.
CAT LADY
What'cha want?
JEEPERS CREEPERS 61
TRISH
A telephone?
CAT LADY
Ain't got one.
The kids look at each other. A whispered aside:
DARRY
You know it's not too late to
keep driving and not stop
'till we see people.
TRISH
What do you think she is?
DARRY
Crazy?
CAT LADY
Whatcha' need it for?
TRISH
Someone's been killed. A
police officer. Down the road.
The screen door opens now and THE CAT LADY steps out. A
strange looking woman of fifty or so. Very intense around the
eyes.
TRISH
We just came from thereMEOWWW...
Sounds of cats at her feet. She pushes a couple
back inside the screen with a foot. A foot wearing a fuzzy
pink slipper.
Darry staring down at the felines. Remembers instantly the
strange phone call at the diner. Did you see the cats yet?
TRISH
It's a ways back. You can't
see it from here.
The Woman levels her eyes at the two. Judging them. Her shot
gun still clenched tightly.
CAT LADY
All right one call.
(off their looks)
But be quick, my babies they
don't like strangers.
Trisha just stares at the old woman. She has children?
JEEPERS CREEPERS 62
Trish climbs the porch steps. Sees Darry still staring down
at the cats inside the door.
Trisha doesn't understand. Makes a face that tells him to
hurry up! He starts forward. Cat Lady opens the screen for
them -again holding one feline inside with a fuzzy slipper.
CAT LADY
Careful. I don't let 'em out
after dark.
DARRY
How many cats do you have?
CAT LADY
More than a couple, I'm
afraid.
INT. CAT LADY'S HOUSE. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
Trish and Darry halt instantly as they step inside:
The living room is covered with cats. All kinds. All shapes.
All sizes. There must be forty of them in the living room
alone.
CAT LADY
Phone's there by the love
seat.
The Cat Lady shuts the front door and steps past them. Stows
the rifle in a closet.
Trish covers her nose with a hand. Makes a face at Darry. The
smell is terrible.
CAT LADY
Policeman killed you say?
Darry still caught in an uneasy trance. That phone call. Did
you see the cats yet?
DARRY
Let's get out of here.
Trish looks at him like he's crazy. The Cat Lady turns to
them now. Trish lowers her hands from her nose.
CAT LADY
People think they can drive
like maniacs 'round here. Cops
too, damned fools.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 63
(MORE)
Just a bunch of punk kids with
badges and guns if you ask me.
Trish moves to the phone. It too surrounded by felines.
Scatters a few as she reaches down and lifts the receiver.
CAT LADY
Who is that making a call on
your telephone, hmm? Who is
that?
She is asking the one cat that remains. Sniffing Trisha as
she dials.
CAT LADY
That's the thing about cats.
(off Darry's look)
Can whiff a bad egg a mile
away. Can't they Tomfoolery?
Darry realizes she is referring to the cat that now rubs
itself against his legs.
CAT LADY
Oh he likes you. Lookee that.
He wants you to pick him up.
Darry nods. Tries to press out a polite smile.
CAT LADY
Don't be afraid.
Darry bends. Pets the cat's head.
CAT LADY
Go on! Big boy like you's not
afraid of a little pussy is
he?
He regards her. Did she just say that? Must mean something
else. He lifts the cat into his arms. Pets its head.
CAT LADY
There you go.
(steps away)
Big thing like you can't go
through his life being afraid
of a sweet little pussy.
She winks at him this time -lecherously. Darry swallows. She
means what she means.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 64

TRISH
Yes, Patrica James. We just
left Trentdale with a police

Are you calling the Trentdale
County sheriff's department?
TRISH
I thought I was.
CAT LADY
Trentdale's the next County
over. You're in Poho County
now, you crossed the County
line.
DARRY
Look I don't know exactly
where the house is I'm calling
fromShe
looks to the Cat Lady to tell her the address, but she is
shaking her head adamantly.
CAT LADY
Don't bring the cops out here!
They try and bust my ass every
year with their zoning crap!
(to Darry)
Try and tell people how many
cats a person can have!
PHONE VOICE
(filtered)
You said you needed to report
an emergency?
But the VOICE IS SUDDENLY SWALLOWED BY ANGRY STATIC ON THE
LINE. Trish holds the phone away from her ear.
Cat Lady and Darry watching. She clicks the clicker. Puts the
phone back to her ear. Nothing.
TRISH
Your phone just went dead.
She is looking at her brother and thinking the worse.
The Cat Lady marches over to hear for herself. Puts the phone
to her ear as the lights go out all over the house.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 65
Darry, Trish, the Cat Lady and her many fuzzy minions
suddenly plunged into darkness.
Darry rushing to the window -the cat still in his arms.
EXT. FARMHOUSE. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
Out in the overgrown garden, the plastic sunflower again
clicks to a stop in the silent, moonlit yard.
INT. FARMHOUSE. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
DARRY
There's nobody out there.
Then every cat in the place lifts its head in unison.
Forty pairs of cat's eyes staring toward the front windows.
Trish and Darry watching this. As growing from every corner
of the room, are the wicked hisses of frightened cats
everywhere.
The cat in Darry's arms freaks -clawing and thrashing to free
itself.
DARRY
Ouch!!!
He winces in pain as THE ANIMAL YOWLS and hits the floor
running. Cat Lady rushing to the front window. Trish and
Darry with her.
The overgrown yard is dark with inky shadows. Her distressed
scarecrow standing in the middle of it.
MORE CATS HISSING. Fur standing on end. Fangs bared. Whatever
is out there, these animals do not like it.
CAT LADY
I'll be Goddamned!
The Cat Lady storming back to the closet for her rifle. The
kids looking after her.
CAT LADY
That's not my scarecrow.

Shot rolling slowly toward: The inky silhouette of the
scarecrow. It is larger than we remember it. And better
dressed. In a long black coat...
The Figure stands before the old hay-stuffed thing-creating a
single silhouette.
Cutting a tall, dark shadow against the starry night sky. One
with eyes we can barely discern.
Eyes that might not belong to any human thing...
INT. FARMHOUSE. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
The cats are going berserk. Two of them topple the phone
table. Others run in confused circles around the couch.
Several scramble over the base of the floor lamp. Send it on
its side with a loud crash. Still others are scaling the
drapes --clawing their way toward the ceiling...
The Cat Lady watches puzzled by her felines.
CAT LADY
Who the Hell is that?
Cocks the rifle loudly and throws open the front door. Levels
the rifle at the scarecrow.
CAT LADY
You gotta 'bout ten seconds to
get your ass outta my yard!
The Scarecrow/Figure stands. Continues to stare in at them.
Silhouetted in the moonlight.
CAT LADY
Don't think I'm gonna tell you
twice.
It's voice. Strange. A raspy whisper.
THE CREATURE
My children.
Trish and Darry exchange glances.
CAT LADY
What?
A chilling whisper in the night:
JEEPERS CREEPERS 67
THE CREATURE
I've come for my children.
Trish and Darry frozen by these words. The old woman turns to
look at them.
When the Figure bolts toward the house!
Cat Lady whirls about. Fires. KA-BLAM!!!
THE SCARECROW DISINTEGRATES. RIPPING INTO SHADOWY BITS THAT
EXPLODE IN EVERY DIRECTION. SOMETHING LARGER RIPPING SKYWARD
AT THE MOMENT OF IMPACT.
The Figure is gone. Vanished into thin air. Unless...
Cat Lady, Darry and Trish crowd the doorway trying to see
out. Darry's gaze caught by something high.
Catches a terrifying glimpse of it scrambling up the front of
the house. Like some horrible caped insect. As if gravity
simply did not exist.
DARRY
What in the HolyHis
cutting whispers turns the women to him. Stares at them
in shock.
KER-KRASH!!!! A WINDOW BREAKS SOMEWHERE UPSTAIRS. All three
whirl around. Staring up at the ceiling.
Then cats are dropping past the front windows. Dropping down
into the yard. From the second story? They land on their
feet. Scurrying off into the night....
Trish and Darry look at each other with mounting panic...The
Cat Lady looks to brother and sis. What the Hell did you
bring into my house?
AS SUDDENLY A FRIGHTENED AND VOCAL TORRENT OF CATS RUSH IN
GREAT PANIC DOWN THE STAIRS!
WITH THE SOUND FROM ABOVE, OF ONE CAT CLEARLY ATTACKING -the
Cat lady storms toward the stairs brandishing her rifle.
CAT LADY
Get away from my babies you
sons-of-a-bitches!
DARRY
Don't!
Darry charges for her. Grabs the old woman.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 68
DARRY
Don't go up there!
CAT LADY
Goddammit!!!
DARRY
Leave now!! With us!
CAT LADY
Goddammit!!!
(screaming up the stairs)
Don't you hurt my babiesShe
catches Darry in the groin with a nasty kick. HE YELPS.
Crumples as she charges up the steps.
TRISH
Darry!!!
Sis hurries to him. Starts dragging him toward the front
door. She just wants out. Wants to go!
CAT LADY
I'll blow your Goddamned head
offBut
at the top of the stairs, the Cat Lady is suddenly
wrenched off her feet!
The kids watch as her fuzzy pink slippers disappear from
view. Straight up.
THEY HEAR HER GASP ONLY ONCE. NOW A CHOKED, GARGLING SOUND.
The kids staring up at the top step where here feet vanished.
The cats are in absolute frenzy. Some baring fangs in the
direction of the stairs, others climbing the old drapes of
the place in a frantic panic to get out. To get away.
Trish dashing back toward the front door with injured Darry.
Halted by the sight of those slippers -slipping now, slowly
back into view on the top step.
Something just out of sight at the top of the stairs is
holding her there. Feet dangling. One slipper falls off.
Darry approaches in horror. Wants to see up those stairs.
Wants to see just what the Hell this thing is...
At the foot of the stairs he looks up. Can see her body
hanging there, lifeless -held in the iron grip of the long
coated Figure --pulling the old woman into him as if she were
a doll.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 69
And sniffing. Sniffing her. The same way he did the officer's
decapitated head.
Darry throws a look to his sister: at the door, hand on the
knob -frozen by her brother's paling expression.
Darry looks back: the Figure takes another long inhale and
then peers around the dangling old woman. Out of the shadows
and down the stairs --directly at him.
For the first time Darry sees its face clearly:
Though the features are human. The glaring blind whites of
the eyes -where pupils should be- give a much more terrifying
impression.
Not of something human but of something else.
Something dark and powerful that only wears the guise of
human. ...Something utterly horrible and without conscience.
It stares at him a chilling moment longer. Again its raspy
voice whispering from its lips.
THE CREATURE
She doesn't smell too good,
Darry.
Darry bolts. He is to the door so fast he turns the knob
before his sister can.
EXT. FARMHOUSE. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
Trish and Darry blasting outside. A flurry of fleeing cats
also pour down the porch steps with them, spilling into the
front yard. The kids scramble to their car.
Trish flies behind the wheel and turns the key. Engine not
turning over.
Darry's eyes scanning the dark face of the farmhouse. MORE
COMMOTION INSIDE. CATS SCREAMING.
Trish with the key. Grinding the ignition. It starts.
KA-TASSSHHHH!!!! THE LARGE UPSTAIRS WINDOW EXPLODES OUT IN A
POWERFUL SHOWER OF GLASS AND WOOD.
The Creature leaps into the night.
Darry and Trish watching it. Some kind of nightmare streaking
across the white of the half moon and then dropping down.
Down into the yard.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 70
Impossibly it lands on its feet. Crouched low to the ground.
Like some horrible beast ready to pounce.
Putting its sites -those horrible blank eyes- on the kids.
DARRY
Go! Go! Go!
The car squeals out of the yard, down the gravel drive and
back toward the highway.
Darry watching as the Creature sprints across the yard.
Disappears in the darkness as the farmhouse gets smaller and
smaller...
DARRY
You see his face?
Trish grapples the wheel. Taking the dark highway as fast as
she is able.
INT. TRISH'S CAR. COUNTRY HIGHWAY. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
DARRY
Come on Trish, you see his
face?!
 A sign flashes by:
RAILROAD CROSSING 1/2 Mile RAILROAD CROSSING 1/2 Mile
DARRY
I know you saw it Goddamn itTRISH
(matching his tone)
One freaky thing at a time,
alright?!
Silence. Both staring ahead now. Darry whispering his new
mantra.
DARRY
He was wearing a mask.
(looks to her)
Trish?
(off her look)
He was wearing a mask.
TRISH
Right.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 71
DARRY
You have to say it too.
TRISH
He was wearing a mask.
WOOOONNNNKKKKKK!!!!! THE HORRIBLE HORN BLARES BEHIND THEM.
The van is close -its headlights blasting the interior of the
car. Startling them as much as the horn.
DARRY
What is this guy trying to
do?!!
TRISH
Darry!
Trish has her own problem: up ahead The railroad crossing
lights flashing, automated arms lowering AND BELLS ARE
RINGING LOUDLY.
Darry out the back squinting into the blaring headlights.
WOOOONNNNKKKKKK!!!!! THE HORN FROM THE VAN BLARES AGAIN AND
THIS TIME THE TRAIN WHISTLE CALLS BACK TO IT.
TRISH
Darry!!
DARRY
Gun it, you can make it!!!
The van is gaining. The train nearing. BELLS CLANGING THEIR
WARNING.
TRISH
Maybe down the tracks!
DARRY
He'll kill us!
TRISH
I can maybe get to the
conductor!
DARRY
Are you crazy?!!!
WOOOONNNNKKKKKK!!!!!
DARRY
You gotta do this, Trish!
JEEPERS CREEPERS 72
The van is all over both lanes, weaving back and forth.
BLASTING THAT HIDEOUS, TAUNTING HORN.
TRISH
He wants us to!
Darry stares at her. She knows this?
DARRY
Trish faster!!
TRISH
(emphatically)
We are going to die!!!!
DARRY
Just do it!!!
THE TRAIN HORN BLARES ITS FINAL WARNING.
Trish slams the pedal to the metal and takes her sedan
blasting through the barrier arms.
It lurches across the track as the train roars at them like
an iron beast.
They fly over the tracks. The train just nicking their rear
bumper. Sends them spinning.
Brother and sister collectively trying to grab the wheel.
Spinning out of control while the train cuts them off from
the van.
The van which slams on its brakes and swerves dangerously
close to the tracks and the train.
On the other side, the sedan stops spinning. Trish trying get her
bearings. Darry still has his hands on the wheel with hers.
TRISH
Let go of the wheel!
Darry looks behind him. Nothing but the train CLANKING
NOISILY over the tracks.
DARRY
We gotta move!
Trish grabs the gearshift but it won't budge. Darry sees this.
TRISH
Something's wrong.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 73
DARRY
Don't say that.
CLANK! CLANK! CLANK! The train's cars fly by -their only
barrier from the van and their predator.
TRISH
The gears are stickingDARRY
(jaw tightening)
Unstick 'em, Trish!
TRISH
What do you want me to do?!
Trish and Darry both grapple the stick shift. Can't wrestle
the car into first gear.
DARRY
Goddammit!!
TRISH
You're gonna break it!
Not seeing, as we do, something black shooting into the sky
from the other side of the train.
BA-WAMMMM!!!! SOMETHING HITS THE TRUNK OF THE CAR. HITS IT
HARD. ROCKING IT VIOLENTLY.
Bro and sis stare out the back: The Creature is crouched
there -staring in at them with those horrible eyes.
DARRY
He jumped over the train,
Trish...
Trish grinding that stickshift -trying with all her might..
DARRY
He jumped over the train,
Trish!
ClUNK! The car's transmission falls into gear and Trish guns
the engine.
The car lurches ahead --jolting the Creature. It clutches the
sides of the car as she speeds forward.
Darry in a stunned, numbed kind of shock.
Trish dips onto the shoulder of the road. Trying to make the
ride rough. Swings across both lanes. Weaving erratically.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 74
Trying desperately to lose the thing on the trunk.
Trish slams on the brakes. The car swings sideways violently.
Finally flinging it into the air.
The kids watch as he flails into space. Coat flapping around
him -like a giant bat who has suddenly lost its equilibrium.
Hitting the asphalt hard and rolling and skidding. Things
falling out of his coat as he does.
The battle axe CLANGING noisily on the ground and another
insidious looking knife, bouncing on the asphalt with a
couple of others --like the Creature, coming to an abrupt and
violent halt.
DARRY
What the Hell are those?
Trish just staring at the motionless heap of black under the
moonlight.
The train's final car moves down the tracks behind them.
Revealing the dark van just beyond the flashing railroad
lights.
Brother and sister staring ahead at the lifeless heap. THE
SOUND OF THE TRAIN FADES IN THE DISTANCE AND THE BELLS AT THE
TRAIN CROSSING CEASE.
Silence now. Only the sound of their breathing in the car
until Darry's whisper.
DARRY
Hit him.
She looks at her little brother.
DARRY
Hit him, Trish.
(off her look)
Hard.
She looks out the windshield. That lifeless mass sprawled on
the highway.
DARRY
Do it!
She opens her mouth to respond -when the Creature's head
rises. It is staring at them. Those blind, ugly eyes burning
out toward them.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 75
Trish slams the pedal to the metal. Corrects the position of
the car and rockets forward with as much speed as she can
build.
The Creature's face caught in the glare of the headlights as
WHAM! Trish slams into it hard.
The car's wheels pummel it savagely. Both kids grimacing with
THE TERRIBLE SOUNDS OF CRACKING AND CRUNCHING BENEATH THEIR
TIRES....
Trish stops now. Looks back at her handiwork.
The cape has flapped over the Creature's head and its
lifeless figure, complete with tire tracks, lays a little
flatter on the two-lane.
Brother and sister exchange glances.
TRISH
You think he's dead?
DARRY
They never are.
TRISH
Right.
Trish throws the car in reverse and speeds back at the
lifeless shape.
KER-POP! A sickeningly distinct sound as the tires roll over
its legs this time.
Trish comes to a halt behind it. Staring ahead into the high
beams: there can be no mistaking this thing is flattened!
On the asphalt, at the end of one coat sleeve, a hand lay
crushed. Tire treads over it. Even bones crushed and flaking
like Greek pastry.
Blowing away now. The whole hand blowing away. Dust in the
wind....
In fact, LOTS of powder is blowing out from under that black
coat...
The kids watch in awe: Have they crushed this thing to dust?
DARRY
Let's get outta here.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 76
TRISH
I don't know how much farther
this car's gonna go.
DARRY
Far enough.
Trish guns the engine again -a final trouncing for the Thing
in the road as they roar over it and speed into the distance.
INT. POHO COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEPT. NIGHT. AN HOUR LATER.
Trish on a payphone in the empty lobby. Darry next to her, listening
in. These kids have been through Hell and they look it.
TRISH
It's the Poho County Sheriff's
Department. It's right off the
main highway about twenty
miles before Trentdale.
I am serious mom, we're okay.
The car, I don't know. Tell
dad we may have to have it
towed someplace.
Darry turns away for a moment. Caught by something on an
opposite wall.
A long bulletin board of missing persons. An ocean of faces.
Men, women and children. Some of the headings read: HAVE YOU
SEEN ME?
TRISH
(O.S.)
I love you. See you when you
get here.
Darry stares ahead numbly. All the faces staring back at him.
TRISH
Hey...
(off his look)
They're on their way. Be here
in about an hour.
DARRY
An hour and a half if mom
drives.
TRISH
Right.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 77
DARRY
Never thought I'd be so glad
to see mom and dad.
(looks to her)
Actually looking forward to
one of dad's "What in the name
of God did you do now?"
She smiles. In this look between them is a rare glimpse of
their true love for each other.
DARRY
We will do it you know? We
will get home.
TRISH
(recognizes her own words
being used mockingly)
Shut up!
In from the night steps JEZELLE GAY HARTMAN. Heavy set. Late
forties. Sweet, plump face. In Capri pants, sneakers and a
sweatshirt, she is a woman on a mission.
DESK SERGEANT
Jezelle.
The DESK SERGEANT is not happy to see her. She walks right
past him.
DESK SERGEANT
What can we do for you
tonight...
The Sergeant out from his desk. Moves after her.
DESK SERGEANT
Jezelle!
Jezelle steps up to Trish and Darry. Studies them.
DESK SERGEANT
Come on Jezz’, they been
through a lot, okay?
She extends a plump hand. A tiny hint of a drawl in her husky
voice.
JEZELLE
You the kids, then? Darry and
Trish, you them?
DESK SERGEANT
Jez' GoddammitJEEPERS
CREEPERS 78
JEZELLE
(shaking Trish’s hand)
Jezelle Gay Hartman, how do
you do?
DESK SERGEANT
Jezelle’s maybe a little
confused about what’s going on
down here tonightJEZELLE
Less confused than Jerry here
would like to think.
(shakes Darry’s hand)
If you were talking to his
Captain? Captain John Develle
who is off duty tonight? He’d
tell you different.
DESK SERGEANT
Jezelle likes to think she’s
the resident psychic around
here.
Behind her back, the Sergeant signals to the kids that she is
not to be taken seriously.
DESK SERGEANT
She helped us on a missing
persons a few years agoJEZELLE
You think you could just let
me talk to these kids for five
minutes by myself?!
THE PHONE AT THE DESK CHIRPING INCESSANTLY. The Sergeant
moves to answer it.
DESK SERGEANT
Go home, turn that Goddamned
police scanner off and go to
bed.
JEZELLE
And you go do something
useful, you got officers
missing!
DESK SERGEANT
I mean it Jezelle, leave 'em
alone.
Trish and Darry left staring at the woman.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 79
JEZELLE
You don’t have to believe I’m
psychic. But I can tell you
something these cops haven’t.
(off their look)
That dust they got off your
car back at Delroy’s? It
tested as human skin over a
hundred and fifty years old.
Darry and Trish listen to her.
JEZELLE
That didn’t come in a dream. I
heard it on the police
scanner. I got more to tell
you and I come a long way to
do it.
DARRY
You know I’m really not sure
we should be talking to
anybody right nowJEZELLE
I know what it is.
Her voice a sudden and urgent whisper.
JEZELLE
I know what’s chasing you.
She has their full attention now.
JEZELLE
You found a lot of bodies.
(off Darry’s incredulous
look)
Down in that cellar. I saw ‘em
too.
(swallows)
You see the cats yet? I saw
you with cats too. Lots of
catsDARRY
You called. At the diner, that
was you.
JEZELLE
I saw those bodies just like
you did. That poor boy with
the stitches all down him... I
saw you there with him.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 80
DARRY
How?
JEZELLE
Dreamed it.
(waits for a response)
I dream a lot of things.
The woman's self-assuredness is dissolving. She stares at
them with eyes flickering with fear and sadness.
JEZELLE
Those bodies down there. You
found its house of pain.
Darry doesn’t know why but his blood runs cold.
JEZELLE
I don’t know how I know that,
I just... know that’s what it
likes to call it.
DARRY
What ...likes to call it?
JEZELLE
It’s got a whole lotta names.
From a whole lotta different
times and places.
Eater of the Dead... That’s
the one that keeps coming to
me.
DARRY
Eater of the...
(off her nod)
What does that mean, it eats
people?
JEZELLE
It has to.
(off their stunned looks)
It has incredible power.
That’s how it stays that way.
How it's lived so long.
Trish tries to leave. Brother holds her arm. Won’t let her.
JEZELLE
I don't like having this in my
head. I don't like knowing
this and not knowing why I
do...
JEEPERS CREEPERS 81
(MORE)
Every twenty-third Spring. For
twenty-three days. It gets to
eat.
Whatever it needs. It eats
eyes so it can see. It eats
lungs so it can breathe...
TRISH
(standing, pointedly)
I’m gonna be sick. Darry would
you come and help me throw up,
please?
DARRY
Look this thing has had
chances to kill us, and it
didn't.
This makes Jezelle even more uncomfortable. What she now has
to say.
JEZELLE
(swallows, her eyes
dampening)
It's very particular. Only
wants ...certain parts from
certain bodies.
One of you has something it
might like.
(Darry swallows)
It won't stop following until
it knows for sure.
DARRY
By trying to run us off the
road?!
JEZELLE
(shakes her head 'yes', her
voice a cutting whisper)
It needs to scare you.
(find's Trish's eyes)
There's something in fear.
Something it can smell.
Brother and sister stare at her.
JEZELLE
Makes it easier for it. To
know if there's anything in a
person it might ..like.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 82
JEZELLE (cont'd)
TRISH
Like?
JEZELLE
Wants.
DARRY
Wants?
JEZELLE
....to eat.
TRISH
Oh fuck you!
EXT. POHO COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
Many off duty patrol cars. TWO OFFICERS just sitting down in
theirs. Coffee cups in hand. Engine turns over and they roll
out of the lot.
While at the opposite end, an old dark van rolls into view.
Its familiar license plate vibrating slightly with the rough
idle of the engine:
 BEATNGU BEATNGU
Now we think about the other way this plate could be read: Be
Eating You.....
JEZELLE (V.0.)
I don't know what it is
exactly. If it's a Demon or a
Devil or just some hungry
thing from a wicked place
somewhere in time.
The van door swings open. Engine still running as one of the
Creature's feet sets down on the asphalt. It's black shoe
marred with a tire track.
JEZELLE (V.0.)
I just know it's been doing
this for a lot longer than a
hundred and fifty years.
And it is not gonna stop.
Coming after you or anyone
else it wants to.
The other leg swings out awkwardly. Out of a tattered pant
leg the foot hangs -barely attached. Only by a length of dead
flesh and a torn sock...
JEEPERS CREEPERS 83
JEZELLE (O.S.)
'Cause once it has the scent
of something it likes...?
With this horrid handicap, the Creature starts a grizzly,
almost comical limp across the shadowy parking lot....
JEZELLE (O.S.)
It can't. It can't stop.
INT. POHO COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
Jezelle pleading with Darry and Trish. Her voice an urgent
whisper:
TRISH
And you don't know how you
know that, you just do,
right?!
Jezelle stares at her. Eyes welling. Looks so sad. Like her
heart is breaking. Like there is something else she knows.
Something too terrible for her to say.
DARRY
What?
Jezelle shakes her head no. Can't speak it.
DARRY
What else?
Darry takes her by her plump arms. Forces her to look at him.
DARRY
Goddammit you told us this
much now what else?!
JEZELLE
(the quietest whisper)
I told you. Jeepers Creepers.
DARRY
I heard it.
(off Jezelle’s look)
At the diner. Nothing
happened.
JEZELLE
No. It’s playing on an old
phonograph.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 84
(MORE)
(tries to sing in her
frighted whisper)
Jeepers Creepers, where'd you
get those peepers?
Darry and Trish looking at each other. This lady has really
gone over the edge.
JEZELLE
(can barely say it)
I hear it playing while one of
you is screaming.
(her eyes find Trish)
Screaming down in the dark
somewhere. Screaming the last
scream you'll everSUDDENLY
LIGHTS OUT! THE HALL PLUNGED INTO DARKNESS.
The Desk Sergeant lifts the phone.
DESK SERGEANT
We got lights out up here.
The facility has come to an abrupt standstill. Trish, Darry
and Jezelle, eyes toward the ceiling.
DARRY
(a whisper)
It's gone. We ran it over
until there was nothing left.
(meets Jezelle's eyes in
the dark)
We killed it.
JEZELLE
It's eaten too many hearts for
it's own to ever stop.
INT. POHO SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. JAIL LEVEL. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
A flashlight blares out the dark as OFFICER TIM MCCURRY
starts the long walk down a shadowy row of cells.
OFFICER MCCURRY
Heads up gentlemen.
His flashlight falls over the first cell. Two bodies sleeping
in upper and lower bunks.
OFFICER MCCURRY
I said heads up, gentlemen.
Show me some skin.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 85
JEZELLE (cont'd)
The INMATE in the upper bunk stares groggily into the glare
of the flashlight.
INMATE
What the Hell's wrong with
you, man?
OFFICER MCCURRY
We have a black out gentlemen.
That means emergency head
count.
(drops his beam to the
lower bunk)
Lower bunk show me some skin.
An angry hand juts out from under the blanket -middle finger
extended. The Officer moves onto the next cell.
OFFICER MCCURRY
Head count gentlemen...
UPPER AND LOWER BUNKMATES peer into the beam. Officer McCurry
moves to the next. Stops when he hears A SOUND.
...A WET SOUND.
McCurry follows it. Moves quickly past several more cells.
THE SOUND HAS GONE FROM SLURPING TO CRUNCHING....
He is at the end of hall now. Approaching the last and
darkest cell. The flashlight falling over something McCurry
cannot believe:
The bars to this cell have been bent outward and apart.
McCurry fumbles with his free hand to get his service pistol
out of his holster. Takes another step:
The man in the cell freezes when the beam of light hits him.
Dressed in a long black coat. Squatting over something on the
floor.
McCurry looks down:
The body of AN INMATE lies in a pool of dark blood. At the
end of his right leg -the foot has been chewed completely
off...
McCurry in shock.
The Figure, ignoring the Officer's presence now, returns to
his work. Bows his head. Suddenly thrashing it back and
forth. The lifeless inmate rocking with the same violent
motions.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 86
McCurry moving fast now. Leaps before the cell. Levels his
pistol.
The Figure's head drops back.
McCurry halted by that horrible WET, CRUNCHING SOUND as the
inmate's arm falls into view:
His hand gone. A bloody stump adding more crimson to the
floor.
McCurry cocks his pistol. The sound is loud and causes the
Figure to turn. Slowly. Until he is staring up at McCurry
past the gun barrel.
McCurry paralyzed: The Creature's white eyes glaring up at
him. Its mouth and chin a bloody mess...
McCurry should have fired by now. Too perplexed and horrified
at what he is staring at...
THWAMM!!! It moves so fast, McCurry only feels the bars of
the cell slamming into his face -and service pistol flying
out of his hand with the impact.
He has been grappled, in a blurring moment of speed, through
the bars of the cell by the Creature's one good hand.
The other hand: non-existent. Just an empty sleeve as he
holds Officer McCurry against those bars.
Nose to nose. Surveying the Officer. Those malevolent white
eyes staring into him.
THE SOUND OF TRICKLING. SOMETHING TRICKLING ONTO THE GROUND.
Both cop and Creature look down at the Creature's empty
sleeve. A grayish powder trickles out of it.
And with it, a new hand. Drops down from inside the sleeve
and splays its fingers. Replacing the one pummelled into dust
by the tire of Trish's car.
The Creature takes McCurry's head in both hands now. Leans
in. Close. Closer...
And sniffs. Sniffs him. Leans in now. Inhales him. Savoring
his scent. -To the Officer's horror and surprise.
LEVELS THOSE MALEVOLENT EYES AT HIM NOW --AND ROARS, THE
CREATURE'S MOUTH GAPING OPEN AND COLLIDING WITH HIS HEAD.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 87
We cannot see clearly what is happening at the dark end of
the corridor -just McCurry's arms and legs flailing madly as
HE SCREAMS.
INT. POHO COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
Emergency lights flickering on. Tiny pools of light from the
corners of the ceiling.
DESK SERGEANT
About Goddamned time.
Trish, Darry and Jezelle staring up at them. Lots of activity
suddenly. Officers everywhere moving around in the semi-dark.
DESK SERGEANT
All right we are going to a
lock down situation, people.
That means everybody sit
tight, and don't move unless
somebody wearing a badge tells
you to.
JEZELLE
He's here.
Trish and Darry look almost angry at her for having said
this. She regards them. Nods in a chilling affirmation.
DESK SERGEANT
You kids wanna come with me?
All three whirl around, startled by the Sergeant, suddenly
behind them in the dark.
DESK SERGEANT
We're gonna put you in a room
down the hall here.
With Jezelle in tow, down the dark hall.
DESK SERGEANT
Uh-uh.
(points a thumb at Jezelle)
Not you, lady Sherlock.
(calls out)
Someone escort Jezelle here
back to the big, blue
Winnebago she's no doubt
blocking the driveway with.
Two Officers step up to escort her away.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 88
JEZELLE
(full of ire)
These kids are still in
trouble! I might still be able
to help 'emDESK
SERGEANT
I told you: outta here!
JEZELLE
You don't see what's about to
happenDESK
SERGEANT
(to the Officers)
Let's get Ms. Hartman out of
here, please.
The Officers start to back her up. She looks to Trish and
Darry with the most frightened eyes.
JEZELLE
He's gonna find you in here!
He's gonna find you 'less you
get outDESK
SERGEANT
Alright now Goddammit knock it
off!!
The Officers take her by the arms now.
JEZELLE
Get away from me!
DESK SERGEANT
I swear I will lock you up,
Jezz'!
JEZELLE
(looks to Darry)
You believe me?!!
Her frightened eyes burning out at him.
JEZELLE
You believe what I said?!
Darry panicking. Doesn't want to believe. Moves toward her as
she is ushered toward the exit.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 89
JEZELLE
I didn't know if it would help
but I had to tell you what I
knew!
DARRY
Are your dreams ever wrong?!
Jezelle just staring at him.
DARRY
Your dreams, are they ever
wrong?!!
Darry unnerved by the horrible sadness on her face.
DARRY (cont’d)
You know, don’t you?
JEZELLE
You have to get out of here!
DARRY
You know who dies! You know
which one of us!
JEZELLE
Don’t let them lock you
anywhere in this buildingDARRY
You know but you don’t have
the guts to tell us!
Jezelle looking helpless. Eyes frozen on Darry.
GUNSHOTS! FAINT. FROM A FLOOR BELOW. A FRANTIC VOICE NOW
CRACKLING OVER A NEARBY OFFICER’S WALKIE.
OFFICER ONE
(filtered)
Up top -this is the basement.
We have a 10-34. I repeat a 10-
34!
The officer takes his walkie off his belt. The Desk Sergeant
hurries to listen in. Lots of commotion on the other end.
OFFICER ONE
(filtered)
Anybody on groundlevel!
JEEPERS CREEPERS 90
DESK SERGEANT
(grabs the walkie)
Kribbs, Go ahead!
OFFICER ONE
(filtered)
We got a situation down here
Sarge'!
MORE GUN SHOTS NOW -HEARD BOTH ON THE RADIO AND FAINTLY FROM
THE LOWER LEVEL.
OFFICER ONE
(filtered)
Its headed toward you! Up the
rear stairs! You copy?!
Trish and Darry exchanging looks. Impossible. Can’t be him.
OFFICER ONE
(filtered)
Coming up the rear stairwell!
Pandemonium in the dark. Officers racing toward the end of
the lobby.
DESK SERGEANT
(to Trish and Darry)
Stay here!
He runs back down the hall -past Jezelle staring at them.
JEZELLE
We gotta get you outta here.
She moves fast for a big woman. Heading down the dark
corridor. Away from the lobby.
JEZELLE
Come on I said!
They move with her. Darry taking a final look back at the
lobby where Officers now hug the walls. Staring down a
corridor that ends in the rear stairwell.
The Sergeant stares with the others at the dark stairwell.
Illuminated by a single dollop of light from one of the
emergency overheads.
Four cops flank the walls before it. Weapons drawn. The
Sergeant hisses an urgent whisper into his walkie.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 91
DESK SERGEANT
Somebody talk to me down
there!
OFFICER ONE
(filtered)
We have one inmate and an
officer down!
More officers responding. Running out of the dark. The
Sergeant waves them back.
OFFICER ONE
(filtered)
Ramirez too, he’s hurt bad.
Son-of-a-bitch tried to take a
bite out of him!
DESK SERGEANT
What?!
A shadow falling over the stairwell. Someone headed up the
stairs.
MORE GUN SHOTS. Flashes from below etching the shadow which
suddenly flickers up the wall and out of view.
Officers staring puzzled. Where did this guy go?
OFFICER ONE
(filtered)
This guy is wearing something
‘cause we cannot take him
down! Copy? We cannot take him
down!
They can hear something moving. Getting closer. Guns aimed
down those dark stairs.
One of the Officers, DANE, looks to the Sergeant. Gets a nod.
Dane moves forward. Hugging the wall. Very close to the
stairwell now.
Jumps aside the doorway. Braves a look down. Nothing on the
stairs. Hears something in the stillness...
A sniffing sound. Somewhere in the dark. They can all hear
it. Puzzled by it.
Down the stairs? Officer Dane looks back at the Sergeant. Not
seeing what everyone else does behind him:
THE CREATURE’S HEAD DROPPING INTO VIEW FROM ABOVE.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 92
Hanging upside down just inside the stairwell doorway! The
officers swing their guns to this horrible visage when -
PLOSSHH!!!
OFFICER DANE’S FACE ERUPTS IN SHOCK! SPRAYED SUDDENLY WITH
CRIMSON. HIS CHEST HAS THE CREATURE’S HAND STICKING OUT OF
IT.
HE HAS PUNCHED RIGHT THROUGH IT! In the Creature's horrible
hand -THE OFFICER'S STILL-PUMPING HEART!
The Creature swings back up out of view. Taking his bloody
parcel with him. The men staring ahead in shock.
Dane just stares wide-eyed with the hole in his chest.
SLURPING AND GARGLING SOUNDS as the unseen Creature ingests
what onlookers don't want to believe he could be.
The heartless Officer tries to say something now but can't
manage it. Falls back and tumbles down the stairs.
The Desk Sergeant and his men are the color of chalk as they
regard each other in the terrible, silent shadows of the dark
hall....
KER-OOSSSHHHHH!!!!! The ceiling over the doorway erupts.
Plaster and dust flying everywhere as the Creature blasts
through the wall and onto his feet before the startled
onlookers.
He is instantly moving. Stepping forward in long powerful
strides through the dust and the confusion --directly at the
Officers and their guns.
Everyone opens fire -bullets ripping through the Creature.
ONE OFFICER SCREAMS BEHIND HIM -HIS BODY RIDDLED WITH THE
SAME BULLETS --FLYING RIGHT THROUGH THE CREATURE AND INTO
HIM.
The men watch in horror as the Officer flails back and
crashes to the floor.
The Creature reaches out. Yanks another off his feet.
Twitches and convulses as the grip cuts off his air.
The Creature still moving. With his other hand, grips the
Officer by the groin. Holds him out now. A human shield as he
strides down the dark corridor watching the other Officers
retreat in shock and confusion.
Two Officers behind him, running at him. One has his pistol
leveled. The other screaming at him not to shoot.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 93
OFFICER TWO
No!!!
Charges ahead himself. A flying tackle at the Creature’s
back. But it is like hitting a mountain. He hits hard and
hangs on -grappling the Creature around the neck.
The Creature still moving. Not even slowed. One man hanging
on his back and one he still holds in front of him.
Others retreating. Scared. What the Hell is this thing?!
DESK SERGEANT
Goddammit!!!
The Sergeant remains in the middle of the hall -his revolver
aimed at the approaching nightmare.
The Officer on the Creature’s back starts to pistol whip him.
Desperately trying to stop him. But in a swift and vicious
move, it swings around -slamming its back into the nearest
wall.
Slamming it hard. The Officer with it. The plaster on the
wall cracks with the impact.
The Officer’s eyes go wide as he spits blood. He collapses on
the floor in a heap as the Creature continues on. His human
shield staring at him -eyes bulging. Air still cut off.
DESK SERGEANT
Goddammit stop!!! You stop
right fucking there!!!
The Creature raises his human shield over his head. Before
the men can fire at his exposed chest --hurls the Officer at
them.
But this is no ordinary throw -the man is rocketing down the
corridor as if propelled out of a catapult.
Men are diving out of his way. One taken out completely.
Tumbling down the corridor with him and smashing into a glass
trophy case.
IT CRASHES NOISILY TO THE GROUND ON TOP OF THEM. GLASS AND
TROPHIES GOING EVERYWHERE.
INT. POHO SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT BACK HALL. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
Trish, Darry and Jezelle hurrying through the darkness. Can
hear the chaos in the distance. Come upon a large rear door
with a safety bar and an alarm.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 94
Darry tries it. Won’t open. Tries it again viciously. Whirls
to Jezelle.
DARRY
This is your way out?!
JEZELLE
The doors must lock
automatically in a power out.
DARRY
You didn’t know that?!
JEZELLE
Well I'm sorry honey but I
can't dream everything now can
I?
Eyes and ears on alert: the distant commotion is suddenly
still. Deathly still.
JEZELLE
We have to get upstairs!
TRISH
We have to get out!
JEZELLE
There’s no other way out down
here except the front.
TRISH
How are we gonna get out from
upstairs!?
Darry sees it first: At the far end of the hall. A familiar
silhouette. Still. Impassive.
JEZELLE
Upstairs.
Trish and Darry dash up the stairs and The Creature takes off
toward them like a rocket.
Sprints so fast his coat billows in his wake, like dark wings.
Jezelle just kneels. No chance she could make it up those
stairs fast enough. Instead, bows her head in prayer as the
Creature races toward her.
JEZELLE
Our Father who art in Heaven,
hallowed be Thy name...
JEEPERS CREEPERS 95
The Creature is so close she can feel his wind... can feel it
blasting past her.
Her moment of doom has passed quickly. She turns and sees the
Creature racing up the stairs at top speed.
INT. SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT SECOND STORY. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
Trish and Darry running for their lives. Where to they don’t
know. The corridors are dark and maze-like.
Stopping finally. Confused whether to keep moving or find a
place and hide.
They don’t have to think long. The Creature roars into view
ahead of them and they start a nightmare flight back into the
maze.
The Creature pursues with incredible speed. The kids
practically falling around corners they are running so fast.
Behind them like some Dark Avenger, the Creature soars.
Gaining. Always gaining.
Rounds another corner and halts: The kids gone. Several doors
they could’ve slipped into. He chooses one.
The Creature in the doorway. This is an interrogation room.
Dark and empty. Caught by its own reflection in the large
mirror on the wall.
A two-way mirror. On the other side, Trish and Darry,
watching breathless. Terrified as the Creature surveys the
mirror and steps toward it.
The kids silent. Holding each other. The terrible visage of
the Thing pressed against the glass now. Does it sense
something behind it?
Those white eyes staring in. As if they could see through it.
And then its tongue comes out. Long. Licks the glass from low
to high in some horrible, pre-culinary gesture.
Trish and Darry watching with repulsion. Then relief. Having
left a snail trail on the mirror, the Creature is turning
away. Turning away from the mirror andKER-TASSSSHHH!!!!
The plexi-window explodes as the Creature
crashes through it. Trish and Darry scrambling back in a
blind panic and a shower of glass.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 96
The Creature in the center of the room. Poised like an
animal, ready to pounce.
Trish and Darry can barely move. Paralyzed with fear as the
Thing steps closer. Backs them to the wall. Brother and
sister, side by side.
Those hideous milky eyes glare at Trish. Burning into her.
Watches as he inches closer.
Darry starts to move. Pinned against the wall instantly by
the Creature's iron grip. Pinned there watching as the
Creature moves even closer to his sister.
TRISH
(barely a whisper)
Darry...
Nose to nose now they are so close. She can feel the horrid
stench of his cannibal breath. Its horrible, raspy whisper
now:
THE CREATURE
Sister, sister...
Watches in terror as it gets so close she thinks it might
kiss her...
But it sniffs her instead.
Short little sniffs at first. Darry and Trish watching this
in horror.
Then sniffs long and deep as Trish stares full of fear, into
those horrible eyes.
Eyes that close as another deep inhale commences. They open
again -abruptly. Stares at her a moment longer and tosses her
aside.
The Creature instantly on Darry. Nose to nose. A big deep
inhale as little brother watches. Tries to find his sister,
somewhere on the floor. His whisper like a child’s.
DARRY
Please let me smell bad...
Please let me smell bad,
Trish...
Another long inhale. This time, the Creature’s head drops
back.
Darry can see the nostrils. Flaring. Fluttering. Nostrils
don’t flutter.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 97
They do it again. As if the scent they were sampling, sent
his nostrils into uncontrollable twitching....
There can be no doubt, as the Creature levels those eyes at
Darry -that it has found what it wants. Something about or
inside him it finds irresistible...
DARRY
Its gonna eat me Trish....
This motherfucker’s gonna eat
me....
CLINK CLANK! RIFLES BEING COCKED. BIG ONES.
The Creature halts but doesn’t turn. The shattered window to
the other room is filled with FOUR OFFICERS IN RIOT GEAR. The
Sergeant their leader.
DESK SERGEANT
Step away from the kid.
The Creature still doesn’t move. Stares at Darry.
DESK SERGEANT
(cont’d)
Darius? Just step this way
with your sister.
Darry stares at the Creature for a long moment. Then slowly,
inches down the wall. The Creature watching him.
Once out from under him, Darry scrambles to Trish and they
fly out the door into the hall. The Creature turns toward
them, but all rifles raise.
The Creature slowly raises his head -eyes glaring at them
from an angry furrowed brow that seems to say Who in the
fuck do you think you are?
The Creature roars toward them and the guns blaze.
INT. POHO SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT STAIRWELL. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
AS THE SOUNDS OF A WAR RAGE OVERHEAD, Trish and Darry
scramble down a stairwell that empties into the dark lobby.
Halted by the bodies scattered everywhere. Like a massacre.
ONE BODY sticking half out a plexi-glass window he was thrown
through.
A BODY at the corner of the Sergeant’s desk is just a torso.
His bottom half no where to be seen...
JEEPERS CREEPERS 98
Trish and Darry blast forward. Sprinting through the
atrocities and toward the entrance. The glass doors -also
shattered by AN OFFICER’S BODY hanging half in and out.
They step over him and out to the parking lot.
EXT. POHO COUNTY SHERIFF’S BLDG. EXT. NIGHT. SAME TIME.
Trish and Darry searching frantically for their car. They see
Jezelle’s Winnebago. But not a sign of their own vehicle. No
way to drive out of here.
Except for the Creature’s black van still idling in the
corner of the lot.
MORE GUNSHOT BLASTS and flashes from the second story.
To Darry, the choice is simple. He is sprinting toward the
van.
TRISH
No!
Little brother sprints to the driver door and throws it open.
A STENCH SO FOUL meets him that he has to grimace. Thinks
twice about this now.
DARRY
I am not doing this Darry!
KA-TASSSHHHH!!!!! TWO OFFICERS COME CRASHING OUT A SECOND
STORY WINDOW.
DARRY (cont’d)
Trisha!!!!!
Before their bodies can even hit the ground, Darry braves the
stench. Leaps up into the driver’s seat. Reaches
instinctively for the ignition. No key. The van is running
without a key in the ignition.
Clutches the gear shift. Sticky. Looks at his palm. Sticky,
congealed, crimson goo.
Its like a thin film over everything.
The passenger door flies open. Trish reaching out for
brother’s hand. Halting with the stench. Staring at him.
He just gives her arm a good yank and she is up and flying
into the seat. The van rattling with her weight. And sounding
like a windchime?
JEEPERS CREEPERS 99
They look behind them and see why: the van walls are lined
with an incredible and grizzly array of spears, axes and
knives.
All hanging from mounted hooks -THE WEAPONS CLANKING AND
TINKLING TOGETHER WITH THE MOVEMENT OF THE VAN.
Blades all stained by an eternity of atrocities.
The Creature appears now. On the roof of the building. Darry
staring in horror at him from the van window. Even at this
distance, caught in his terrifying, demon-blind glare.
TRISH
What the Hell are you waiting
for?!
Darry grapples the sticky gear shift again -tries to get it
in first. THE GEARS GRIND -SHRIEKING AS IF THEY WERE SOULS
BEING TORTURED.
The Creature vaults forward. Leaping impossibly off the roof
of the building and onto the roof of Jezelle’s Winnebago.
Landing on his feet. Glaring at Darry. Starting across the
parking lot.
Not on the ground. He has leapt into the air and is leaping
from police car roof to police car roof with each stride.
DARRY
Hang on!
Damned gears. They grind away.
Trish staring back -the Creature leaping from car to car like
some nightmare gymnast. Its tattered coat flapping like dark,
distressed wings.
Darry finally forces the gearshift forward. Doesn’t know if
he’s in first or not. Guns it.
It lurches roughly and stops. Must be in second.
The Creature hits one final car top and vaults into spacedirectly
at them.
TRISH
Darry!!!
The van lurches forward again. Moving now but not fast.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 100
KE--RONKKK!!! The Creature smacks into the side of the van.
His face rearing up into Darry’s window. Staring in. Darry
terrified. Still trying to get up speed.
DARRY
Give me something!!
Trish out of her seat. The van lurching again. Throws her
into the back. Tries to keep her balance. SPEARS AND BATTLE
AXES CLANGING ALL AROUND HER.
The Creature rakes his claw-like fingers across the glass in
a circular motion. Slicing into it with A HORRIBLE SHRIEKING
SOUND!
DARRY
Get me something!!!!
The Creature rears his hand back -ready to strike the circle
he has scored in the glass...
DARRY
TrishSomething
smacks into the palm of Darry's hand. He doesn’t
even take time to see what it is. Just swings it at the
window hard.
KER-TASSHHH!!!! He hits the Creature directly in the face
with a small combination hatchet/hammer.
Glass flying out everywhere as the Creature drops off the
van. Crashing to earth as Darry speeds away.
DARRY
Yesss!!!!!!!
Trish watching. Wants to smile too. Shout with joy like her
brother.
DARRY
(shouting into the
rearview)
Motherfucker!!!!!
But instead Trish stares out the back windows of the van.
Watching the dazed Creature raising his head. Staring after
them as they get further and further away.
Darry guns the engine. The van is really moving now. Roaring
away from the Sheriff’s building and down the empty two lane.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 101
TRISH
Darry...
A warning from sis. Brother checks out the rearview: the
distant Creature is on his feet now. And running.
Running toward them.
DARRY
(his smile more manic now)
He’s kidding right?
In his rearview: the Creature sprinting after them. Sprinting
like Hell.
TRISH
He’s not getting smaller...
He is actually gaining on them. His legs a blur of darkness
he is coming so fast.
Darry checking the speedometer: the van is doing 120 miles an
hour. And the Creature is gaining on him.
DARRY
You mother.....
Darry’s foot flattening the gas pedal. To the floorboards.
The old van shakes and quakes at this velocity. THE SPEARS
AND AXES CLANKING NOISILY.
Then another impossible nightmare: the sprinting Creature,
without slowing down- throws himself forward like an acrobat
doing a running tumble--
But when he completes his flip -landing on his feet again- he
uses the momentum to push off. And in an affront to gravity
everywhere: rockets himself up into the night sky.
Up and gone. Out of view. Brother and sister both saw it.
Look to each other.
WHOMP!!! SOMETHING HITS THE ROOF OF THE VAN HARD. AFFECTS
THE VAN’S TRAJECTORY. IT WEAVES ACROSS THE ROAD. DARRY TRYING
TO WIN BACK CONTROL.
KA-RANKK!!!! The Creature's battle axe punches a hole in the
top of the van, right in front of Darry’s face.
DARRY
Trish!!!
She scrambles for one of the spears. Grabs a shorter one.
Thrusts it straight up. Over her brother’s head.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 102
THWAAMMPPPP!!! Pierces the roof and puncture’s the
creature’s head. Directly above the eyes!
The Creature loses his grip on the van, slides back and off,
falling onto the road again.
Darry watching in the rearview.
DARRY
Yes!!!
Hits the asphalt hard. The spear dislodges as it rolls over
and over down the two lane.
DARRY
Yessss!!!
Rolls and rolls and suddenly leaps up, lands on his feet and
keeps on coming!
Darry’s enthusiasm gone. Just watches breathless as this
inhuman thing comes at them again!
The Creature has never moved faster. So fast powder is coming
off his skin, a skin being eaten away by the actual wind
shear at this velocity.
DARRY
Yeah! Burn your ass up you sonof-a-bitch!
He is like a comet now -a rocket of dust blasting down the
highway toward the van.
TRISH
Watch it...
Trish scrambling for another weapon.
THE CREATURE’S VELOCITY IS MAKING ITS OWN HISSING SOUND...
Brother and sister listening to it grow LOUDER AND LOUDER.
Trish with an angry looking battle axe at the ready. Sees the
SCREAMING dust storm is almost upon them.
KA-POOOMMM!!!! The back doors blast inward as the Creature
explodes into the van.
Trish thrown ahead against the dash. Darry losing control
again. The van hits the shoulder of the road hard!
Inside the Creature advances. Trish lurching forward with an
axe at the ready for him. She swings it:
JEEPERS CREEPERS 103
THWOCK!!! HIS HEAD IS NEATLY SLICED OFF. Leaves a small puff
of dust at his neck as it rolls right out the back of the van
and down the highway.
The Creature’s headless body staggering back. Trish staring
at it. Charges ahead with the same weapon and hurls it!
Direct hit! Knocks the torso back out the doors.
It hits the asphalt hard and goes rolling and rolling in
sporadic puffs of dust...
DARRY
Yes!!!
The van roars ahead. In the distance. A TRAIN WHISTLE. Darry
listening to it. Looks at his sister.
DARRY
Where is he?!
Trish takes no time to stare out the windows again.
TRISH
He’s dead! He doesn’t have a
head!!!
DARRY
He’s not!
TRISH
Darry! He doesn’t have a
fucking head!!
DARRY
He’s not!
TRISH
How’s he supposed to eat any
thing without a head?!!!
Brother and sister staring breathless at each other. Darry’s
words are calm now. Almost whispered.
DARRY
He’s not gonna stop.
(emphatically)
He is never gonna stop,
Trish!!!
The Railway crossing ahead. The CLANKING SOUND of the WARNING
BELLS and the Automatic arms.
DARRY
Get out!
JEEPERS CREEPERS 104
She can’t believe he said this.
DARRY
I mean it, get out!
(off her incredulous look)
There’s grass over there!
TRISH
He’s dead!
DARRY
He’s not! We both know he’s
not!
THE TRAIN HORN BLASTS NOW. A warning it is almost to the
crossing.
DARRY
Do it!!
WHOMP!!!! SOMETHING AGAIN HITS THE ROOF HARD. THEY BOTH LOOK
TO EACH OTHER!
DARRY
TRISH!!!!
TRISH
What the Hell’re you gonna
do?!
KA-RANNKKK!!!! Down comes the Creature’s hand again, making a
larger hole in the roof of the van, grappling for Darry’s
head.
It finds him. Holds on tight. Darry screaming. Trish races
forward.
TRISH
Look out!!!
She swings the axe again! THWOMP!!! The hand grappling her
brother is severed. It falls to the ground and she kicks it
out the back of the van.
It hits hard in a cloud of dust...
Up top: the armless, headless Creature reaches down again
with his one remaining arm...
DARRY
Goddammit Trish, I’m not doing
this for nothingJEEPERS
CREEPERS 105
TRISH
You’re not doing anything
without me!
She takes another long sharp spear and thrusts it through the
roof of the van.
Up top: the spear-head pierces the Creature’s headless torso,
pinning it to the top of the van.
This makes him more angry. His remaining arm reaching down
for Darry -grapples with new violence for his head. Finds it.
Darry trying to wrench it off him. It starts to pull him
upward.
Trish runs forward with her axe but little brother surprises
her. Grabs her arm and pulls her onto his lap.
TRISH
Darry!
Forces the axe out of her hand. Kicks open his door. Looks
terrified as he flashes a last look at her.
DARRY
Bye sisThrows
his sister out of the van. She screams as she hits
soft grass and rolls and rolls.
The train is upon them. WARNING BELLS DEAFENING. LIGHTS
FLASHING.
And Darry clutching the arm of the Creature as tight as he
can. The creature lifting him -up out of his seat.
Darry fighting it. Bracing himself with his hands against the
roof of the van.
DARRY
You got me?! You got me you son-ofa-bitch?!
Huh?!
THE VAN ROARS THROUGH THE RAILWAY CROSSING, BREAKING THROUGH
THE AUTOMATIC ARMS.
Trish in the grass, stunned. Looking out. The van on a
collision course with the oncoming train.
TRISH
DARRRRYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!
JEEPERS CREEPERS 106
THE TRAIN ROARS AHEAD -ITS WHISTLE BLASTING AS THE VAN
REACHES THE TRACKS AT THE SAME MOMENT.
The headless Creature struggling. Darry clutching it’s arm -
helping it to remain impaled to the roof of the van, as--
KA-BLAMMMMMM!!!! THE TRAIN SMASHES INTO THEM!
THE VAN CONCAVES IMMEDIATELY. RUPTURING THE GAS TANK AND
EXPLODING IN A SAVAGE BALL OF FIRE THAT SENDS ROCKETS OF
SMOKE AND FLAME LAUNCHING OUT OF THE INFERNO IN ALL
DIRECTIONS.
Trish is already crying. Sobbing as the blast lights her
bruised and bleeding face.
It is raining debris now. Fiery debris and bits and pieces of
cloth and metal.
But nothing human. Nothing inhuman for that matter. Trish
stares ahead from the grass. Sobs. Inconsolable in the tall
grass.
SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. TRAIN CROSSING. MORNING. TWO HOURS LATER.
Trish in a police car. In the back seat. Wrapped in a
blanket. Still in shock. Workers sifting through the ash and
debris of what lay across the tracks.
Jezelle knocks on the window. Trish rolls it down.
JEZELLE
Your parents are waiting for
you back at the Sheriff’s
Building. I heard it on the
scanner.
Trish doesn’t look at her. Just stares out. Jezelle draws a
breath and starts to step away.
TRISH
Your dreams are wrong.
Jezelle stops. Turns and looks at her.
TRISH
Sometimes. Darry didn't die
like you said he would.
JEZELLE
Sometimes.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 107
Jezelle nods in silent agreement. Though there is something
in her eyes we cannot discern.
She turns away. Moves toward her Winnebago. Trisha looking
on.
Somewhere we hear the tune Jeeper’s Creeper’s. Instrumental
version. Playful. Strange in this grim context as we:
SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. OLD PACKING PLANT. LATE DAY.
Somewhere off that same country two lane, in the long shadows
of the dying sun, this old packing plant sits. It is rusted
and sagging and as we approach, and our music continues, we
begin moving down.
Down toward the ground beneath the old structure....
INT. OLD PACKING PLANT. BASEMENT LEVEL. NIGHT.
In dank darkness, the music continues. Sounds like it's
playing on a phonograph somewhere. Yes a phonograph. The old
kind with lots of analog hiss. We move toward the music,
along an empty wall.
At the end of which, in the long shadows, a tall figure in a
cape-like coat busies himself. Though we can’t tell with what
until we are up close.
Sewing. Stitching. Fingers working nimbly with coarse black
thread.
We see now the wall is not entirely empty. Several bodies are
mounted there. Not the ancient dead we have seen underground
at the church.
These are fresher. Of much more recent demise. Sewn together
in the same grizzly fashion we know too well.
And then KER-PLUNK! A new body is hung next to them. Hung on
a hook which we cannot see.
Young Darry. Eye lids sewn shut with large, nasty looking
stitches. The latest addition in this new mural of human
horrors.
JEEPERS CREEPERS 108
The instrumental bridge of the song ends and the lyrics echo
in this vast underground chamber.
...Jeepers Creepers, where’d you get those Peepers? Jeepers
Creepers, where’d you get those eyes?
Echoing as we begin to back away from this sad and grizzly
sight... the Creature beginning to sew Darry onto the others.
As this begins WE SLOWLY FADE TO BLACK as our song continues:
...Jeepers Creepers, where’d you get those Peepers? Jeepers
Jeepers, Weepers Creepers, where did you get those eyes?
